553772,5,"Unite oil is the best thing I have found for dry graying hair.  I soak it in my hair at night, when I know Im going to wash it the next morning. And best of all I slab it into my hair when Im going to play tennis, slap on my tennis cap and give myself a two hour hot oil treatment while Im running around the courts. It works the best for keeping my hair soft, smooth and less brittle!  And hopefully it will quit falling out!!"
34775,1,"I was not impressed. It didn't do anything, other than smelling amazing, for removing my makeup. I wear waterproof mascara and my coconut oil worked better at removing it. I would skip this one. I'm returning it to get some money back. It's like floral water - refreshing but does nothing."
441347,3,"I guess it is OK.  I just have to motivate myself to use it as total time to use the Nuface with attachments takes 35-40 minutes.  I guess I should think I actually save time and money instead of having a facial."
184436,5,"I really enjoyed this product - it does exactly what it says. The tingle initially feels a little unsettling, but you get used to it rather quickly and the peel really makes your skin feel smooth!"
56098,5,"Got here on time and he loves the boss!!"
53617,5,"I've always loved this cologne! Over the last 4 years I've bought this cologne for my boyfriend and it's still his favorite one. It's super long lasting and it's not a overbearing scent. He put two squirts of his cologne on in the morning, then worked on his truck and played football all day... And that night you could still smell it on him. I'll always purchase this cologne."
150805,5,"I love it! I have very sensitive skin so it tends to dry the skin around the blemish out, but it does reduce the size overnight."
411893,5,"I'm always been a biolage girl..love it!"
175584,1,"It has too much oil and the skin feels extremely greasy.."
381704,5,"Perfect!"
386255,4,"I started using Grandelash MD after I had lash extension. Though I don't have a lot of lashes to begin with, they definitely are fuller after about a month of using this. I will continue to use for a fuller lash. Upper photo is Before, lower photo is After."
171242,4,"This doesn't work as well as TNS essential serum or Recovery Complex for getting rid of wrinkles, but pretty close. It smooths wrinkles out a bit and gives your face UV protection at the same time along with adding the same color tone to your whole face. I used to use TNS essential serum, TNS Recovery Complex, TNS Dermal Repai, and TNS Retinol. It was to much time. Now I just use this and almost get very close to the same great result in a fraction of the time. I've repurchased it several times and will continue to."
346203,5,"I've loved!"
482233,2,"Liked product but ran out of gel before cream and whole tube does not last long enough for high price. Need to lower this price or increase the value"
498480,5,"It works!"
334071,5,"After a year of using soap from the drugstore, I broke down and spent a bit more on this, and I'm so glad I did. It foams great, brushes on well, shave smoothly, and smells wonderful. It also leaves a bit of a tingle as an added bonus."
353606,5,"Lightweight but effective cleanser. Can easily remove any make up without blocking the pores. Great product for oil or combination skin."
228735,5,"Love it!"
286613,5,"Light and has a slight astringent to it."
14571,4,"I use this as a moisturizer on my face and enjoy it because it is tinted and I don't want to wear makeup. I have to use more than most women because my skin is dry but at the end of the day my skin still feels moist. Those little red bumps that pop up with other creams don't happen with this. The price is hefty but so is skin creams from Macy's."
311552,5,"I love this cologne....smell great and the bottle is big. Very happy with my purchase"
116451,5,"Perfect!"
28798,5,"Most amazing polishes I've ever worn!! Pair this with the zoya top coat and my nails stay painted longer than they ever have with other polishes. I'm absolutely amazed, I'll never use another base and top coat."
185201,5,"Have used this for years love it"
92859,5,"Soothing; like moisturizing your face with yogurt.  I don't know if it does anything unique but it feels nice and works well.  Seems to calm sensitive and irritated skin."
475804,1,"It has a horrible chemical smell and it  faded black in the light"
467300,5,"By far, this is the only product that can keep my skin healthy and acne-free."
403203,5,"Love this lipstick.  Stays on for hours."
530570,5,"Great product!!!"
416891,4,"This is an excellent moisturizer if you are looking for shear coverage. It doesn't have a lot of cover at all. I was out in the sun all day, had EltaMD on, my whole body burned besides my face. I think that says a lot about the SPF they use. It protects your face from the dangers of the sun's rays. The EltaMD has a dewy look too. I would suggest anyone this product, it really is light and does a great job!"
94975,5,"I love this product. I had no intentions if it working as well as it does, because my hair is so damaged, but it has honestly helped bring it back to life and make it more manageable, soft, and shiny."
201019,2,"Didn't live up to the hype as far as I'm concerned.  A tad greasy and too thick.  Results weren't noticeable."
198372,5,"Love this stuff. I heard raves about EltaMD but had never tried it. Due to pregnancy, I can't use the daily SPF moisturizer I usually use (cetaphil daily spf) but I wanted something safe that wouldn't aggravate my sensitive skin and would keep it supple. This works for that reason. I keep getting told I look younger lately."
244358,3,"Not quite what I thought it would be,  it stayed on almost a week which is better that most polishes but had to touch up around 5 days."
296591,5,"All i can say is that i love it. Great fragrance , great price. I live in Dominican Rep and they wanted to charge almost twice its worth for a 50ml bottle at a perfume store. It smells great, lasts long ,soft. I have 6 men fragrances, 3 for when I am going to work, run errands , regular use, and 3 for special occasions, Date, party, restaurant, interviews ect, and Montbblanc is my top choice. I strongly recommend it"
259249,5,"This sunscreen is very light and non-irritating. Best hypoallergenic face lotion tried to date. I would buy this product again."
181150,5,"Love it!! I have used Hot tools before and have always loved it. This one is also one of the fine pieces!! :)"
98092,4,"very good"
132139,5,"Does a great job of creating a hair line and hiding the gray."
192335,5,"Wouldn't be with out it.  It is great for my fine hair.
Love the way it makes my hair feel"
538208,5,"Effective product, but I ordered the mask instead of the gel, grrr! Beware of what you buy lol"
485720,4,"Very good shampoo to reduce loosed hair."
307699,3,"It's ok, but not the best for fine hair."
468678,5,"I bought this product for my husband. He tried cheap brands like Axe, and Got2Be  all fails. Then we looked online at youtube videos.. and recommendations, and bout Suavecito, Viking, and Reuzel. Reuzel held up the hair all day and it did not get crusty. It also is water soluble and washes out with easy."
107781,5,"Great product, just too big of a barrel for my hair. I ended up ordering the next size down. My hair would not hold this size of curl"
474496,5,"Arrived quickly, seems to be the real thing not a knockoff, smells amazing if you're a guy considering a good cologne, i went to sephora and smelled every guy cologne and this was by far my favorite so im buying for my boyfriend. Has an earthy woody smell not to overpowering, at sephora the regular bottle or smaller bottle is like $80 this one is double the size half the price!"
166069,4,"Looks ok on your head."
526474,5,"Not for my skin"
107146,5,"The best ever for my girls' hair!"
465120,1,"First Mascara I ever bought that was clumpy and thick. Absolutely can stand and a waste of money."
216733,1,"This item was returned because it was defective. TNS is a good product, but this one was old and the pimp did not work.  There should be no star, but posting is not allowed without one"
172043,5,"I have very dry skin and this is one of the only moisturizers that make a difference in lasting hydration for me. Love it!"
15992,5,"Love this sunscreen. I spend a lot of time outdoors and on the water.  This is one of the very few sunscreens I can use on my sensitive skin and it doesn't sting when I sweat and it gets in my eyes..which is a real plus.  I use it every day."
93208,2,"Smells good, but too expensive for what you get and seller doesn't do returns without hefty charges!"
206299,5,"Consider spending the money on a good razed and reasonable refill blades. I get a better shave with this razor than any disposable and I don't have to keep buying plastic junk where they basically give you the handle and kill you on the price of the blades."
324453,1,"counterfeit-don't purchase"
383155,2,"My hair is short but I found it just weighed it down.  I didn't like the waxy feel.  Wish I could send it back.  It had good reviews is why I bought it.  It might work for a man's short hair or super short hair."
18983,5,"Excellent Tool!"
391979,5,"Takes very little shampoo. Works well. Thick and suds better than most shampoos I have used for colored hair."
43547,1,"I don't usually write reviews but i felt this was necessary. This product is garbage and I'm upset I spent so much on it. Does not lather at all, leaves my hair snarled even after using conditioner. Left my hair dirty and greasy(and I have thick dry hair).
The other thing i noticed was that my hair even smelled dirty. Not the day of the wash, but the next day it smelled gross. Do not buy this product, use redken instead."
31988,5,"This is a great wax, works just how I needed it to. I would take the tea tree wax over the same version of the normal Paul Mitchell wax of this style."
297761,4,"I've been using this for about two weeks now and overall think its a good product.  As moisturizers go it's a good one and I really like the fact that it doesn't smell and goes on really smoothly without any greasy or tacky residue.  The SPF is a bit low for me for everyday use and I do consider that a flaw. The packaging is nice and the container is pretty robust.  Overall a really good product."
153636,5,"Product arrived on time and was properly packed.  Have used this hair product for years and will continue to use."
253036,5,"Zirh has done it once again! Love how it feels, not greasy, definitely a quality product.  I strongly recommend it!"
462614,5,"I was so excited about this palette. once it got here it came in good condition all though it was too small but other than that i love the colors"
201377,1,"I generally love L'Occitane and have purchased a lot of different products from them and have been happy. This gel, however, was a disappointment and a half. I am quite healthy, not allergic to anything, and have put my usually sturdy skin through many a product, many of them questionable, and never had a reaction. But after using this shower gel for 3 days when out on vacation, I became extremely photosensitive - something that has never happened to me before even though I am quite outdoorsy and have spent quite a bit of time in the sun. Photosensitivity is basically a sun allergy that expresses itself as an extremely unattractive and highly visible skin rash every time you go out in the sun.  And I am certain it's this shower gel. I did not eat anything I don't normally consume, was vacationing a place with safe water, and the rash came out everywhere but my face - the only place I didn't use this soap on. The allergy went away two or three days after I stopped using the soap, but I nevertheless went through quite an ordeal. HIGHLY UNRECOMMENDED, whether you have sensitive skin or not."
158087,5,"All I can say is wow. Great product."
270751,5,"HAS REALLY HELPED MY EYES. I USED TO USE ANOTHER BRAND."
42666,4,"Best lubrication from a shave product I have ever used.  You really only need a small amount for big performance.  Only thing keeping me from 5 stars is the cost.  But honestly, it lasts a long time so it is worth the money and I keep buying it."
266264,4,"Great Product.. Great Shipping Thanks..."
558315,5,"I liked how the cream feels when you put it on.  It goes on very smoothly and it moistrizes very well."
371565,5,"good"
540011,5,"I have terrible eczema. And for over half a year, I've been trying to get rid the eczema around my mouth. I put this on one time, it's so moisturizing. My skin wasn't flaking, which is quiet embarrassing while wearing makeup. Love it. I'd buy it again. It makes my skin look supple and dewy."
327893,5,"Best voluminizer! :D"
114819,5,"This is a great product if you do it right, that is. Anyone can do it at home. It works great. I love it. And I got it on time."
135236,5,"Wear this instead of lipstick and you get a lip conditioner as well as color all-in-one product super stuff !"
339568,3,"I guess the expectation is that aftershave is going to be very strongly scented. And maybe some people even buy it specifically for that reason. However, even in a world of strongly scented aftershave, this is almost too much for me to bear. And the smell lingers for hours, I can still smell it on myself after 4 or 5 hours.

The smell, in and of itself, is pretty good. I like the way it smells, I just wish there was maybe a tenth that much fragrance added to it. And it feels very soothing and nice, and doesn't seem to cause breakouts or clogged pores. Everything about it I more or less love except for the abusive levels of perfume. But, like I said, for some people, this may be a feature and not a flaw."
144790,1,"My thick hair requires serious heat to style, and this curler, set at max, did zilch. My Chi flat iron (with the same advertised max) works great, so clearly this one does not get anywhere near hot enough. I checked w/ a cooking heat gun, and it was only around 100F after 15 minutes of warm up time, while the Chi registered 385F. So don't waste your money on this one."
150165,5,"Great product for getting rid of pimples."
359955,4,"I first bought the Trinity off EBAY, what a mistake, hurt like heck & broke after 2 uses, It was a fake I'm sure of it, the gel safety cap was not there and the gel wasn't even the real thing, then I bought an authentic one with the eye & lip attachement, the real deal off a authorized site. I think it works different on everyone, great for the jowls and doesn't take too long either, it does lift them to look much better, haven't seen too much improvement other places on my face. The eye & lip attachement is ok, only difference I see is it does take the puffieness away for sure. The trinity don't hurt me in any way and I use it on the highest. I use Spectra 360 Electrde Gel instead of the expensive nuface gel, much cheaper. If you don't want to spend the big bucks I'd try the Dermawand first and see if you even want to keep up with it, both are time consuming but I think worth it if you have the extra time."
385283,5,"Perfect for travel and summer. Suelo clean every Day"
434284,5,"I was so excited to receive this box, mostly because I was told it was free which it was not. This beauty package (although not free I was charged for it) is amazing. Not only did it have way more items in the box than I thought would be in the box, it came in a beautifully wrapped box. Nowadays there are so many different beauty products on the market its hard to know which one is right for you and I hate buying something and spending all the money only to not like the product. The Bliss mask is so wonderful and left my skin feeling and looking amazing, I am definitely buying this product in a full size version. I also really enjoyed the Wen hair conditioner sample and I think I will also try this product again in the future it left my hair feeling so soft and manageable. What I was most excited to try was the The strivectin sample, I have always wanted to try strivectin but its so expensive and I was scarred to spend that much on something that I may not like. To my surprise so far I really like the strivectin cream, I think I will need to try it a bit longer to see if I still like it and see any results, The only thing that I wasn't a huge fan of were the fragrance samples, they were not for me."
250437,5,"LOVE THIS!  Would recommend if you apply self tanning lotions and gels, no mess, looks even every time."
475990,5,"Upon first use, you think there won't be much coverage, yet the product is a dark horse. Wonderful coverage, while still illuminating the skin. Love it. Repurchasing."
474354,3,"I've used StriVectin High-Potency Wrinkle Filler lotion for a few weeks now and can say that the product does have my face and neck feeling baby soft, but I do not see any visible difference in my wrinkles.  I'm 54, and have a few on my face and forehead that I would love to lessen the appearance of.

This container is 15 ml - that's one half of an ounce.  Tiny container with a huge price tag.

I also notice a build up of product on my face after I use this - almost like I put clear fingernail polish on my face and its now peeling.  Not a good feeling.

Wrinkle filler?  I wish."
284678,5,"My favorite toothpaste and flavour!  Quick shipping and wonderful product!"
1003,2,"Doesn't work used whole tub as instructed."
363577,5,"So bright. It did last. Everyone gave me compliments on the color. I'll be wearing it next spring and summer again!"
394799,2,"My daughter, 15 yo, and myself, old mom, got to play around with both the NUDE and SAND colors.  It was fun.

One thing I can tell you is that neither the SAND nor the NUDE will work for anyone with a really pale complexion.  My daughter is blessed with a peaches and cream complexion and both of these concealers looked like blushes on her.

One the other hand, I with my slightly reddish complexion did fine with both.  Go figure.  I put it on my cheeks where I have a tiny broken vein and both hid it.

PROBLEMS
-- When I say that the SAND and NUDE concealer hid the tiny red line that is my broken vein I mean that if I dabbed them on that they did their job.  If I swiped them on they did not cover the spot.  You have to build up some of the slightly waxy concealer.

-- Which brings up another problem that I noticed.  The moment I put a foundation on over the concealer the concealer vanished.  It would appear to have dissolved and blended too well with the foundation.

-- I also found another test subject.  One with an age spot on her hand.  I've put up two pictures with and without the concealer so you can see it at work.

-- Pale skin.  I talked about it above but if you are pale neither of these concealers will look natural.  With my poor camera skills you might not be able to make out the difference, but I tried to show what they look like on my daughter.

SUMMARY
I'm actually likely to wear this without foundation.  The reason being that if I dab-dab-dabbed it on it certainly covered nicely but it didn't stay put when I tried it with foundation.

If you a pale go with something other than Nude."
497145,5,"have been using this for years .... glad that I've found a gallon that is eligible to ship internationally."

474641,1,"I do not often leave reviews but thought I should post my experience. I received the product quickly (Prime). The canister had a few small dents which is not a concern to me, but what is a concern is the fact that it had NO SCENT. It smelled a little like alcohol going on and I thought that would disappear and leave a nice scent. Nope. No scent. I reached out to Amazon and they quickly responded by refunding my money. Im not sure if the product I received was old or perhaps not really from ORIBE. Im very happy with Amazons response, but very disappointed in the product."
122991,5,"outstanding."

436467,4,"It's very good item I like it"
85459,5,"I purchased OPI Im Not A Waitress because I loved the color and how long it lasted when I got my nails done at a salon. Decided to do them myself to save money. Applied a base coat, two coats of OPI color, a top coat (base and top coat by Sally Hansen) and then another layer of top coat the next day. The photo I uploaded is after a week of wear. I did dishes, cooked, typed, opened soda cans, and even chipped ice off my stairs - all I have is a small gap at my cuticle line from a bit of nail growth and a tiny chip from the tip of one nail on my right (pre-dominant) hand. The secret seems to be to make sure all layers cover the actual edge of your nail...plus getting a good nail polish that won't peel, like OPI."
346094,5,"I just received my order of the Babyliss Pro hot brush. wow, I am so happy with it. My hair is just like when my stylist blows it out, amazing! Soft, shiny, and the brush was easy to use. I wasn't sure if my hair was going to be long enough but not a problem. I have a short bob. ..
The brush is hot enough to style like one needs, the bristles are long enough to catch and spin. I am vey happy with this item...my hair looks amazing."
237840,5,"This is expensive but a good product and it works well with the lotion. Regular usage does help in reducing the KP"
525004,3,"The nail polish was thinner than I expected."
188913,4,"I was hesitant to order this because of the reviews that said it was not genuine ... but, it is. Poor packaging, however."
384988,5,"I received this product today and tried it on for the first time. After hearing so many beauty gurus raved about it, I decided to give it a try myself since I am in need of a decent highlighter for my dull/dry skin. It gives an instant healthy glow to my skin without looking too dewy. The brush that came along with it is so soft it blew my mind. It also picks up just the right amount of product and distributed it seamlessly. I recommend this to anyone who's looking for a good highlighter. It is a little more pricey than some drugstore ones but for the quality and longevity, it is totally worth the extra bucks."
531266,5,"Got it for my friend's birthday, he loves it. Thank you!"
252155,5,"I was a little hesitant that this would work since every curler i have bought (even the heated ones) never work for me. And most of them pinched my skin. I have asian eyes and eyelashes. So thats why most curlers pinch my skin and because my eyelashes were so straight they never curled or last long. i tried this as soon as i got it. And it worked! i didn't even apply it for long and my lashes were curled all DAY! i don;t like wearing makeup and now that my eye lashes look longer i don't have to were mascara on a daily basis for the natural look. But when i do wear mascara my eyes pop! i love this! i completely recommend this!"
479956,5,"To remove eye makeup with micellar water, also been through all the towelettes that promise to remove 99.9999% of your makeup with one sweep.
Well none of them worked and I was skeptical of this and bought on a whim to put my order over $35 for free overnight delivery.  Works incredibly well. One cotton pad per eye and stubborn waterproof mascara is done and I get to keep my lashes in the process."

123627,1,"This lip stain is a very pretty color, but it does not last more than 30-45 minutes. I was hoping for a stain not a lip gloss."

253780,1,"I don't know if I got a dud but this might be the worst eyeliner I've ever tried. It was dried out completely. As in it did not draw a line. I did my research before I bought it and was extremely disappointed."
296052,1,"I think it is a fake. Because its not stay long time. You feel it only first 2 hours then finish :(
I regretted to buy it."
445737,2,"I purchased this product because my hair is treatment damaged. I didn't think it worked any better than my regular conditioning products from a well known brand found in most if not all stores. It worked fairly well but not worth the purchase price."
75300,4,"Well I would have rated a 5. but I meant to buy my wife clean ""shower fresh"" for Christmas. even with the exception of me making the wrong purchase; the whole transaction was very fast and I would rate it a four only because a mistake I made... thanks"
187318,4,"Love this powder, only wish it came with a better applicator. If you press too hard the top pops off and makes a big mess. I still highly recommend it, just be careful when you apply it."
500672,5,"Archipelago candles are fantastic. The scents are complex and earthy."
66397,3,"I primarily use the darker color in this set. The lighter shade is just too light...I look like I went to a tanning bed and wore the goggles. So, it's not really cost effective when you pay what you pay and can only use half of the product. I really liked the Stila concealer I had before this one."
317633,5,"Works well on fine hair. Easy to comb through.  And yes, the scent is yummy!"
252490,4,"Pretty good product so far hasn't made a huge improvement for my face but has been good for non-face acne."
277959,5,"A very rich and creamy exfoliant. It just feels good and leaves the skin very supple, fresh, and perfumed. Or so my partner says! :)"
300132,5,"This stuff is pretty darned expensive but worth every cent! It actually works! I don't particularly like the taste of it so I use a little dab of my regular tooth paste along with it on the tooth brush. I'm an old f**t and have been smoking & drinking coffee for eons so my teeth tend to become very discolored. This Supersmile Whitening Accelerator leaves my teeth nice and white...even my dental hygienist commented on the amazing difference."

29939,3,"The aesthetic for this product is what you're paying for. The quality of the actual toothpaste is mediocre at best - not as minty or refreshing as expected. The packaging is gorgeous, but that's about it."
312946,1,"I like the build and feel of the unit.  The two times it worked I was happy with the product.  Of course 2 uses and then going dead equal about $50 a shot.  I cannot seem to get any support from the merchant as is is 15 days our of the 30 day return window."
483107,5,"My wife is very pleased with the rollers. They are easy to use and the curl and body really last.her hair looks healthy and shines- even the greys. She puts them in while she gets ready for work."
531890,5,"I tried this as soon as I got it and it works. It make a bun, stays up for a long time and does not pull your hair. I'm older and have older hair so the size works great for me."
559032,5,"Not sure why everyone is dissing this hair spray, it's perfect!!! I'm picky so believe me when I say this, it could not get any better! Very lightweight but holds all day, also adds a little bit of shine."

I use a lot of their products.  It does a good job moisturizing while smelling great.  I get lots of compliments on the smell which is nice to find one that smells more masculine."
232466,5,"The best shampoo that I tried in the last few years. My favorite!
It gives my hair amazing volume, smells delicious, I love it!"
233057,2,"I did not want to be one of the many reviewers who complained their hair became greasy and overly full of residue, but sadly I am. I like PM shampoo but this one is lousy.  I wash my hair every other day and on the second day my hair usually is a bit oily but tolerable, after using this shampoo it was really dirty looking on the second day. I had to re-wash and it's still gross. So I would stick to their Shampoo One Or Shampoo Two. The Color Protect shampoo is a total dud, but I can see how they feel the residue might soften colored treated hair but it just doesn't work for me."
412976,5,"Love it! Came well packaged, great product, and it is exactly as pictured"
38240,5,"I started wearing this makeup back when I worked at a day spa in Seattle and have been hooked ever since.  Good price for it here!!"
305962,5,"Love it!  Goes on smoothly. Makes my foundation glide over any lines and gives me a healthy, youthful glow. Highly recommend this product!!"
497982,5,"I purchased the whole Resurfacing line of products on a cruise also. Price seemed high but it really works. My pores are much smaller, skin smoother and brighter within 2 weeks."
273558,2,"I wanted bigger curlers so my hair wouldn't be huge like it normally is when I have smaller curls. I never use this curler anymore because it barley does anything to my hair."
396643,5,"it's easy to use and looks natural"
526893,5,"Untangles my fine hair and smells wonderful"
537572,5,"Is PERFECT for Lord &Berry pencils. I like that you can make pencil tip pointed or rounded. Very handy."
264337,5,"Thus is a great smelling cologne. Has a nice looking bottle. The smell of wanted last through a 12hr shift of running around and still smells great. Get lot of compliments from coworkers."
291631,5,"This cream has a great consistency and spreads easily with clean fingertips. It only takes a very small amount. The coverage is light, but it has built-in light diffusers and even makes my 50+ y/o skin look glowing.  You can use a concealer anywhere else you need extra coverage. I bought from seller ""b-glowing"", and she was wonderful to work with and helped me. I would recommend you purchase from her."
165504,4,"Worked as described!"
536329,5,"So beautiful.  This fragrance is so elegant. I've had it in my living room for about a month now. It's sweet and musky and not too strong. I would highly recommend this product."
310573,4,"Has anyone had trouble with the packaging? It doesn't work at all."
225603,3,"Nice product with effective synthetic sunscreen.  I'd rate it higher except I don't use it a lot because of the taste.  I know taste is a subjective thing but this one is horrible.  It's also dramatically over-priced for what it is.  Equally moisturizing and protecting lip balms can be found for a fraction of the price.  Because SPF lip balm needs to be applied frequently, you should really fall in love with using it...and I guess I'm just not in love with this one."
163511,1,"I had one of these as a kid. It worked great, so I found one online and bought it. I tried it out on my daughter first. It did the opposite of what it says it does. It got tangled in my daughters hair after I rolled it. She started crying. We couldn't get it out for an hour. We ended up cutting some of her hair. It was horrible, but maybe it is just my daughters hair."
468909,4,"I've previously used 32oz tubs of Layrite and Suavecito. Reuzel is similar in texture, scent, and hold to Layrite. It works best with damp hair. I've been told twice that I smell like an old man, but a classy one at that. It has a vanilla scent. If you want bang for your buck, Suavecito is the way to go. But Reuzel holds it down pretty well, and it comes in a pretty cool tin."
523439,5,"These are wonderful for foot care, it does soften the skin and you can add your own formula. I still prefer to have someone else do it for me...amen"
382890,5,"Excellent product."
107498,4,"I liked this product very much. It's a great way to very quickly thicken your brows and brush them together all at once. They do not have a blond color available, and I was hoping that since I purchased the light brown it would slightly darken my light blond brows so I wouldn't have to use a pencil to darken them as well. Unfortunately that is not the case, but this product did thicken my brows and brush them and give them a wonderful finish  is such a quick amount of time that I will certainly purchase this product again."
480457,4,"This is a high quality face powder. It only needs to be applied once per day and has quite a bit of staying power. I love the design of the packaging. The clear hinged cover on the top keeps the powder from flying everywhere. The complaint that I have with this product is that even though I didn't travel with it and kept it in the same place every day, the powder cracked into pieces just a few days after I got it. Other than that, it is an excellent product."
265718,5,"Love the color and coverage. Stays on forever."
569213,4,"There is SO much about this item I really like, love the scent...its (to my nose) a kind of citrus but nothing that would make you think its going to clash with anything you might put on as a cologne...its slightly tinted (just for looks I am sure, as there is no color when you put it on your skin) it is a really moisturizing product that makes you feel pampered and spoiled.  Not greasy, smooths in easily.  I have not noticed any changes in any of my discoloration areas.  I am fair skinned and have freckles and I have a couple of light discoloration areas that this has done nothing to so far.  I love the feel of the product but wonder if I would actually purchase it, as it is on the higher price end (for me, who is used to this kind of product being 25.00-40.00).  I DO appreciate that they put a small plastic spatula with the product, I am kinda weird about putting my fingers into a product as this does cause cross contamination and it can make your skin products go bad faster...so I DID appreciate that being with their product.  I think this is a very nice product and if money was of no concern to myself I would probably purchase it, if money is not a problem for you I would think you might be very happy with this, and I hope it will lighten any spots you might have."
89123,5,"Great razor. I had a short handle but the long handle is a lot easier to maneuver and control."
306564,5,"I got this for my wife to use. She LOVES it! After using this product for 2 weeks her skin looks more youthful. The skin on her face, neck/throat and ears has firmed up and fine facial lines have smoothed out. This product smells great, like fresh fruit. The serum actually feels good on your skin, it's easily absorbed. It doesn't weigh down your skin or make it feel greasy and heavy.

You can feel good about purchasing this product because it's made without parabens, petroleum, propylene or butylene glycol, sodium lauryl sulfates, pesticides and phthalates. If you have allergies no worries with this product because there are no artificial dyes or synthetic fragrances.
Plus this brand NEVER TESTS ON ANIMALS which is a big positive! The product is made in the USA :) and it was manufactured using solar power, they use sustainable and/or recycled paper and print with soy ink.

A responsible company making a product that works!... I'm hooked. A+"
302219,5,"This shampoo has a very pleasant smell and makes my hair shine. I will continue to use it.  Try it."
239891,5,"This product is expensive, but you get what you pay for.  Stops dry skin for 12 to 24 hours. Soothes and smooths but does not cause itching while it is absorbed into the skin.  No scent and does not smell ""waxy"" after it dries."
310556,5,"i tried this product and wow, i am so pleased. just a week use and a friend of mine noticed how good my skin looked already. i am a long time user of la mer and various other products. ive used all la mer products, serums, eye balms, lifting complex etc..and they do somehow work better than all the other brands ive tried. but this product now finally topped la mer and finally, i can switch to this permanently and it is not as expensive as la mer. i cannot say how much smoother and brighter my skin looks. This one is really awesome."
284657,5,"Price is steep, but worth it. Flavor is pleasant and not overwhelming. Foaming is minimal. Looking forward to trying other flavors in future."
278765,5,"I ordered this product with the hopes that it would be as good as the professional products sold.. It is! Very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to others."
251894,5,"Why didn't I try one of these sooner?!  No more pinched eyelids or pulled eyelashes,  good tension,  compact.  I took the advice offered in another review and chose the pink curler as I have dark lashes (dark curler for blonde lashes)  as the color contrast does help you see what you are doing.  No more metal curlers for me."
41079,5,"Have used this for a long time as love it. Came on time and packaged good. Was easy to open also."
516937,5,"Ive been using my pmd for a about a year and am just now able to use the red discs. Im surprised that my face can take them but it really can! Ive had a facial twice and was told both times my skin was too sensitive for exfoliating treatments or even steam on my skin. Either they're wrong about me having sensitive skin or after working my way up with these disks even sensitive skin can acclimate to using the red disks.

I have KP on my cheeks and this is the only thing that takes my bumpiness totally down. My other skincare concerns are anti-aging, acne scar fading and congested skin and this helps with all of the above. I use once a week as part of my routine and have noticed big differences. My skincare soaks in so well and my makeup goes on so smooth for days after treatment."
118534,1,"I checked the packaging, it was all good. The scent is very faint and does not last. I was ripped."
20238,5,"I have been using this Rusk hair volumizer for several weeks now and it is the best I have tried. I have very fine thin hair now thay I am older (67) and this makes my hair look and feel like it is 18 again. I learned through experience that just a dab rubbed tween your hands and applied to towel dried hair will do the trick. Dont think that you need more, it will weigh your hair down and make it feel sticky. It is very humid here inNH today and my hair still has volume. I bought this because of the reviews and so happy I did. Thank you to all the people who review their purchases here on Amazon, I won,t buy anything without reading the reviews."
282369,5,"I like all CND Shellac as far as shellac goes.  This color is very pretty.  Goes on great and lasts!"
242040,5,"Used it for years and have no intentions to change it with any other brands I have tryed so far. The best!"
14823,2,"I've been using it 2 times a day for 4 months. Unfortunately, i did not get the result it promised, even  though i am 30 yo and just started to get wrinkles. I think (hope) StriVectin gave some good to my skin overall, since it is full of great ingredients. However, i  cannot really see it.
The bottom line is it  was too expensive for me  (even though i found it for $95) for the result i got.
I plan to go with Shiseido next time. My friend got rid of wrinkles with it."
361338,4,"I am a cosmetic junkie.  I admit it.  Blush just happens to be one of my weaknesses because I think I have to own every color and finish made to man.  I have a lot of ""The Balm"" cosmetics and they are all of great quality.  This blush is HIGHLY pigmented.  It takes very little to do the job and it does last all day.  At least on me it does and I have normal skin.  I think it is a great buy and you will be totally pleased with it.  Give it a try!!"
92712,1,"Great product but showed up broken in two pieces with lotion everywhere."
284502,5,"Love it."
16224,5,"Perfect for giving my clients a ""blowout"" looking curl - especially great for clients who's hair doesn't respond well just with a blow-dry."
392277,3,"Grate if you want to smell like an old Italian guy. I thought this was going to be a sandal wood sent. But it's more like my great grandfather smelled after a trip to the barber."
267929,5,"For use with the PMD machince not much to say about it works great helps fine lines and wrinkles will buy again"
438179,5,"I don't straighten my hair every day, I do have very wavy hair and it takes me about 30 minutes to straighten it, however this seems to work I'm still figuring out the setting I want to use, I do not want to fry my hair. I love how smooth it is when I finish, great product"
298987,4,"Since I have been using the Nioxin treatment my hair loss has slowed down quite a bit along with a healthy diet.  So easy to apply."
453966,5,"I really like this block, it gives my skin a dewy complexion.  It does have a very slight white cast so I add Skinceuticals Matte sunblock , which has a slight tint, over the  Eau Thermale Mineral........works well for my pale skin."
160584,1,"Because of its active ingridients, this sunscreen is considered a ""chemical"" sunscreen rather than a mineral. Too expensive to nat be good for you."
168195,5,"I decided to try this stuff and I fell in love. It is so cool and moisturizing I just absolutely can't live without it. I spray it on my face before my make up and it helps to tone and moisturize my skin and make my makeup go on much better than it would without it. Also if you're like me and pop any zits on your face then spray this on after you pop them and it will look like you never even touched your face. No more going around with a red inflamed face because you popped your zits  (plus it will help close your pores afterwards). I always thought this stuff was kind of silly, paying so much for a small amount of water in a can.. But I kept hearing people rave about the other brand that's more expensive and I decided I'd give it a try. I didn't want to spend a lot of money on it so I found the cheapest one I could find with the best reviews and bought it. I can't say enough good things about it, not one single complaint! Maybe except for the fact that my first can came with a broken cap but that's literally there only complaint I have. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
65357,5,"Brilliant. Been looking for a non allergenic Deo for a long time.  This one has no side effects. Will purchase again."
309485,5,"This is my preferred stuff to keep my hair in the right place without looking shiny, crusting up, or being tacky and overdone-looking.  It's subtle but holds well throughout a busy day."
373609,4,"I have used this twice so far and am a huge fan.  When I painted my nails, I smudged too spots and this smoothed out both areas so well, you couldn't even tell there was a smudge.  I have two small children and so my hands get abused and this makes polish that normally only lasts two days, last for a week.  Make sure you don't let it dry on the skin around your nail- it can cause your polish to peel when it peels off your skin"
5255,5,"Great spring color"
226937,5,"This is the best lotion on the market by far (and Ive tried everything!!) I have been using for years and have recommended to many people (who are all now huge bioderma fans). I wash my hands frequently (housework etc) and they get very dry/irritated. I use this a few times a day and always put the lotion on a before bed and it makes them like new overnight! Excellent body lotion too. The pump is a great feature. I keep one at work as well. Dont know what Id do without it!"
275257,5,"If you want those perfect ringlet curls, this curling iron does the trick without burning and drying out your hair. Be sure to use a protective spray on your hair before using this product. Also, I would suggest using the glove that comes with it. My hair holds a lot of heat, and so I can accidently burn myself from using this iron on my hair. The glove is a great additional bonus because of how you use this to curl your hair, however, the texture of the glove makes it easy to catch on stuff and it's hard to grasp and hold the hair while using this curling iron because of the material of this glove. Otherwise, I think it's worth it. Be sure to hold the hair around the iron for several seconds to get a long lasting curl that holds."
196989,2,"Very dilute, weak fragrance.  I have to use 6-8 pumps on my neck for someone to be able to detect the aroma a foot away from me, and even then the aroma is essentially non-existent after a couple hours.  Also the fragrance is nowhere near as nice as the same fragrance by C&E in the old after-shave lotion, wish they would bring that back.  Not the quality I'd expect for this price"
368589,2,"I would love to give this product 5 stars but the smell is so strong it makes me nauseous. It makes my hair silky in humidity but I can wash my hair and still smell this product in it."
552724,5,"By far the best curling iron I have ever used. I can never go back now. It's gentle but very effective."
103893,5,"I love this stuff!! Before I started using it, my nails were always weak and broke easily. For the first few months, I did the recommended two coats about once per week, but I did not reapply it everyday as suggested. My method seemed to work just fine for me. I have seen a significant change in the strength of my nails. Now that my nails are stronger, I only do one coat of this polish per week. It also works great as a base coat under colored polish."
400636,4,"It  won't make my hair go flat,and helps mend my split ends."
517200,5,"im very happy with this product! i really like the texture , i can really see a difference after using it!"
432329,5,"Better scent than the normal beard oil scent"
162442,5,"love it"
234393,5,"I've never shelled out much for aftershave, sticking mostly to Aqua Velva, Nivea and the like. However, I found myself traveling a lot this year and purchased this for my travel toiletry kit as it's in a great leak-proof design. Now I'm hooked. It leaves my skin feeling refreshed, cooled, taut, and well moisturizer. Would recommend!"
111553,5,"These towels are so easy to use and create a very natural tan. I've been using them for years."
403416,5,"Great and doesn't smear/crease in the lid"
213540,5,"We have been using this for a while. It was recommended by our dermatologist. Smells great and is very gentle for sensitive skin. Clears up the acne nicely."
318060,5,"I love this sunscreen.  My skin is very sensitive and this sunscreen goes on smoothly and is not too heavy."
265058,5,"I love this lotion, it smells great!.  This is by far my favorite lotion.  It comes with a convenient pump which makes it super easy to apply."
182440,5,"Really works"
85205,2,"Havent tried it on my nails yet but it was useless for the Acetone/Syrofoam Experiment. Didnt try the Dry ice one"
62054,5,"Very good quality product and it smells really good too."
196778,5,"I love the product but the bottle would not spray. Had to get a different bottle to be able to use the thicker."
501640,4,"I bought it for my boyfriend as a birthday present and he likes it. I got the travel size bottle so he could try it out and see how he felt about it without buying a huge expensive bottle. So far he likes it but not enough for how much it cost."
525928,5,"Wonderful smell, not overly strong! Will definitely purchase again!!!"
79700,5,"Great products! Works like it says it does. Hair is magically straight and brilliantly shiny. I recommend to all. Will definitely purchase again & again."
97238,4,"I got this for the grandkids and they like it.  However, this is not economical, as compared to other brands."
11605,5,"how can you go wrong !!"
281594,5,"This has a great scent...and just enough sparkle!  I bought several and gave as gifts too...I will reorder when I run out!  This is my go to lotion that I put on when we are going out...it gives your skin just a nice glow."
438330,5,"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this straightener!  I had my hair cut at a Paul Mitchell school while out of town, and they used this straightener.  I loved it.  My hair has been dyed frequently over the years, and left the ends dry and frizzy.  This Express Ion Smooth straightener makes my hair look much healthier!  It seems to add much-needed moisture to my hair, and gives it an impressive shine.  It heats up in a matter of seconds.  It has temperature settings ranging from 240 to 400. I do not need to have the temperature up all of the way...I use mine at 280 and it works great.  The plates get hot, but the handle portion does not.  I have owned other brands of straighteners, but none seem to work as well as this one."
417079,4,"I have several tattoos and sometimes I have an event where I do not want to show them off, so I use Dermablend to cover them up. This is a very thick makeup , so it really covers and blends very well. I would have preferred a lighter color, because I am very fair, but this color works when blended and covered with a powder. Perfect for special occasions when I want to look more ""elegant"". It also is great for covering up moles and freckles."
50967,5,"I love this oil. It's light and has a pleasant fragrance. I use regularly on dry hair and skin, and have even given it as a gift."
227780,4,"Have not usd nail corrector yet but other items received are what was expected."
356434,5,"Did great on my frizzy curls and smelled great too. Love that it is all natural. A little goes a long way to avoid crunchy hair!"
56739,5,"I got this for my wife and she loves it."
247377,5,"Keeps face clear of Menopause breakout."
42655,5,"It's my favorite shave lotion ever!"
80319,5,"Great buy!"
539025,3,"The eye shadow and blending brush are not great - I was disappointed in their quality.  Bristles are uneven and seem cheap. The others are pretty good, but I expect more overall from stila."
546703,2,"I miss the old volumizer."
472612,4,"Serum was great,however content was a bit small"
553842,5,"great color, not blase, not black but highlights eye color. I am over 60 and I think its great for everyday but you can add more for an evening look"
227194,3,"This was just OK for me.  Made my skin red and didn't really moisturize."
439246,3,"This didn't seem to work as well for me as it does others. But it smells wonderful and the shipping was super quick"
567197,5,"Beatifull!"
519625,5,"This stuff is as smooth as silk! I keep mine in the refrigerator for the ultimate cooling effect during the summer. It does have a rather strong fruity smell, but the benefits far outweigh the scent."
188595,4,"An esthetician recommended this product to help prevent/control breakouts. Very few ingredients which I consider a good thing. Provides good moisture without clogging pores. Good for sensitive skin or skin prone to allergies. Doesn't feel oily. This takes 5-12 days to get so order a couple of weeks before you run out!"
389204,4,"I have long hair with shorter layers so it took quite a few tries to get the hang of using this properly.  However, each time I successfully use it, I seem to have a different experience.  Sometimes the bun is so top heavy that it pulls away from my head a little bit, causing it to look like a fake hair accessory but I remedy the situation with a bobby pin.  Sometimes I have difficulty getting the two sides to meet perfectly to make the bottom of the bun so I will have to pull more hair around or use a bobby pin to secure the two sides together well enough to cover up up the Wrap Up.  I really like the look of the bun it creates.  Sometimes I will twist my hair up myself or just wrap it up into a messy bun so I call my Wrap Up bun the ""professional bun.""  I do wonder how long this will actually work though.  Every time I take it out of my hair, it's a little bit more of a bent mess and I have to take a minute to do my best to smooth it back out.  I would say that it the wire inside will probably bend or warp within a couple months of use, if even that long.  However, I will probably buy a replacement if this happens. It's definitely a life saver for second (or even third) day hair."
502829,4,"really happy with this kit, the only thing is i'm noticing a temporary darkening of the skin, but other than that very effective for my constant hormonal acne"
210573,4,"I was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves. I like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and I am not made of money ya know. As a mass produced soap it's actually really nice. It loads well, though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones. The scent is nice and has some staying power. The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well. A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better. without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti-inflammatory properties."
378523,2,"Smells wonderful, and that's about it. As a hair conditioner, I think it's next to useless. But to use the bottle up sometimes I mix it with a good conditioner so My hair has that awesome smell. Won't buy again, but I will miss that fragrance."
312207,4,"This is product is a fun way to keep lips hydrated - thanks!"
333830,3,"Seems to be good, but nothing spectacular!!  I'm still searching for that thick lather and fresh scent.  This is a good shave soap, but I don't think I'd get it again."
566092,4,"It's a nice conditioner and works well with my hair but it's a little too pricy for me to purchase again."
85481,5,"Love the CLASSIC reds.
Hard to find on the shelves."
22418,5,"very good product but its not instate hair must have some hair on your head"
573240,5,"Smells nice and doesn't make hair crunchy."
474898,3,"It smells super strong not a bad smell but its just strong  it tones ok its nothing out of this world i see slight toning  i have almost finished it the only reason i wouldnt repurchase and don't like it is because i will rinse and rinse over and over and it still suds up i can never get it fully out of my hair"
377285,1,"The actual product is good...if you can get it out of the dispenser.  Very poor design.  I would return it if it wasn't such a hassle."
509180,5,"This really helps to heal annoying pimples. I especially break out on my chest and back and this helps to make them heal quicker."
63409,2,"If you like the smell of AOS Sandalwood, that is about the only thing going for this product.  Really there is more scent coming from the other oils in the product as compared to the sandalwood essential oil.  The other thing is this is an oily product that is thick and sticky.  If you like to wetshave with water rinses in your sink, you can bet this will leave an oily very sticky ring on the sink after only one shave.

I recommend using Proraso Pre as it is just as effective, picks the hairs up better for a shave, and rinses very cleanly.  Do a pre-shave for effectiveness not scent as any scent is not going to make it through the soap lathering, rinse and resultant aftershave anyway.

I've also used non-lathering shaving creams like Kiss My Face ad Cremo Creme as pre-shave alternatives with very good results as well."
380239,5,"It's everything it says it is.  I don't like to spend a lot of money on hair products, but this one is definitely worth it."
40396,5,"Arrived in good condition as expected. Would recommend"
567235,5,"We stayed at the Grand Wailea Resort in Hawaii many years ago and the complimentary lotions/shampoos that the hotel offered smelled amazing. I thought about buying some from their gift shop but they were seriously expensive.  The first time I smelled this lotion, it took me right back to Hawaii.  I love this scent!  And...it's a pretty good lotion too!"
164979,5,"A+++"
473553,5,"Wonderful colors for my olive toned skin."
488356,2,"The tabacco and vanilla smell nice after the dry down but I get a malt like beer smell that was hard to get bye."
310188,5,"Awesome product for summer or winter."
452306,2,"""Coming up Roses"" is the name of this color?!! It's a drab shade of pink. Not happy. Not impressed."
536630,2,"If you are wondering if this is a substitute for the Turbo Body Wash, it isn't...not even close.  Doesn't really have a smell at all and lacks suds.  You have to use a ton of it in order to feel clean.  Will not buy again."
296434,4,"Smell good and have good resistance and I like. I recommend for does man that like to smell good. I would buy again."
211535,5,"Love, love, loooove this lotion, the scent is my fav, scent goes fine with virtually any perfume that I wear without clashing, just a very pleasant, soothing, refreshing, light floral scent...highly recommend and this big bottle is a great value, refill my smaller bottles with it, including the tiny one I keep in my purse!"
466237,4,"My wife likes this Lacoste ""Pour Elle Sparkling Eau"".  She tells me the scent is a little strong but does fade over time.  The actual scent she likes and so do I - slightly flowery jasmine scent with a bit of spiciness.  Certainly not a generic scent - somewhat unique.

The actual bottle is also attractive/ elegant looking with high quality build and of course the cool Lacoste alligator on it.

We have the 3 ounce bottle which is pretty large - at current price of $76 on Amazon it certainly appears reasonable price for a nice perfume and large size.  Tip:  I did see some lower sale prices on the 3 ounce bottle via google search (one sub-$50).  Tip2:  if you're not sure - get the smaller size bottle for less $$.  Overall 4-STAR rating from me in consideration of price/value."

479592,5,"i didn't really believe the claims made about this product but I thought I would give it a try.  Wow! The claims are absolutely true. My skin is no longer dry and each day I can see an improvement in the my formerly sagging skin.  I am a lifelong advocate of StriVectin Multi-Action Restorative Cream."
11839,5,"I have used this on and off for years.  I really believe it helps with wrinkles and overall ski tone.  This is my all time best facial product.  Give it some time and it really works.  I often get asked what I use for skin care care and i tell people this product.  But no one buys it!  Maybe the price is high , but you only need a little."
441440,3,"Just ok - didn't really live up to the hype. You have to apply AFTER makeup for it to cover at all and even then it's just ok, plus it doesn't really last very long. Tried using it to cover bruising on forehead that wasn't all that bad to begin with, but concealer wasn't very satisfactory."
37413,5,"Even though this is meant for a man, I bought it for myself.  LOVE the fragrance and the smooth way my face feels after using it.  Would definitely purchase again."

317231,3,"I'm forever in search of the perfect blue. This is getting there color-wise, but the formula leaves a lot to be desired. It's thin and streaky, very sheer. I wore it over white and it looks kind of terrible. I'll be changing my polish asap."
9534,4,"I would recommend this product. It does what it is supposed to do. However, I would say that you should follow it with a really good moisturizer as it can be very drying.  Also the name is a bit of a misnomer. I don't know how gentle it is. The beads are a bit rough. So be gentle when rubbing it on the skin and a little really does go a long way.  Also, I don't recommend using this product on a daily basis, perhaps every other day."

My skin and hair healthy got improved since I start to use this brush and a better shampoo. Using this brush is like getting a hair massage."

263142,5,"I have been using this for a few years and love it. It works amazing whether I want to scrunch my hair or straighten it out."
72619,5,"Billy Jealousy makes great products. It's that simple. I've been a fan of BJ's (hehe, sorry couldn't resist) for some time now. I can't imagine shaving or washing my face with anything else.

However, when it comes to cologne I am very picky. I am not the kind of guy who has a cabinet full of dusty old bottles that I like to rotate. Instead, I prefer a nice ""signature scent"" that smells great and is unique enough that you don't smell it on everyone else.

I recently discovered that my old favorite brand of cologne, Dolce and Gabbana tests on animals. And since I personally not believe a beagle needs to be forced to drink cologne, or a cat needs to have it rubbed in their eyes, I threw out my bottles and sent a nasty letter to Proctor and Gamble (makers of D&G fragrances.) Unfortunately, this meant I needed to find a new smell.

I've been wanting to smell this product for some time, but living in Northern New England I was unable to locate it in a store. And the online retailers that I purchase from never seem to offer it as a checkout sample. So I traded some emails back and forth with the company's president (yes really, very responsive company) I decided to just go for it and buy it. The scent finally arrived and I could tell from the very first spray, this was for me. It's clean and fresh. It reminds me a nice summer vacation day. I've been wearing it every morning since. My wife is a fan too, except one minor problem. I commented to her recently that I noticed a couple female co-workers kind of sitting extra close to me in meetings and sort of leaning into me in hopes of smelling it. It's definitely intoxicating and the sort of smell you want to smell ever more. The design is simple and includes a few crisp notes like bergamot citrus, ivy, ginger accord, nutmeg and sandalwood. I would classify this as a fresh, green-citrus fragrance. While some scent experts might call this a summer/daytime scent, I plan on using it for everything since I personally thing that heavy oak/wood scents are a bit too grandpa and going way of of the doe-doe bird.

In short, another great Billy Jealousy hit. My next purchase is an small travel atomizer so I can have this scent in my travel bag for work.

My profile (since this is important in reading scent reviews) - A 32 year old, married, Supply Chain/Operations Manager for a billion dollar BioTech corporation. I typically like fresh scents and men's products from hip and trendy companies that do not test on animals."
158323,5,"For the first time in 15+ years, my hands aren't dry and cracked.  By mid-winter, I typically have split skin on my thumbs and have to wear band-aids at night with cream underneath.  A friend who is physical therapist recommended I try Yu-Be.  She washes her hands multiple times each day and found this to be the only skin cream to keep her hands moisturized.  Initially I was put off by the scent but it dissipates quickly.  It's a camphor-like smell.  It's not strong but not something you'd expect in a skin cream.  Knowing how well it works, it could smell a whole lot worse and I'd still apply it!"

123176,5,"This looks so natural. I love it. I've had two people comment on how great my skin looks. I don't think they realize I'm wearing anything. I have a hard time finding a powder to match my complexion. I am black and Asian and am very tan but with yellow undertones. This matches so well."
541429,5,"I love the fresh true lemon scent! I feel like I'm showering in a hotel every time i use it. A FABULOUS home spa experience!"
207194,5,"Can't go wrong with this really. I use it every week and haven't had any troubles. Anyway, that's the idea, it's so simple that it requires little cleaning/maintenance, and is very hard to break.

- Doesn't come with blades
- Real metal (great build quality)"

370701,5,"great cover and feels good"
556121,5,"This scent skews towards a pleasant floral.  I usually steer away from floral scents but this one has a sweet and crisp smell that I enjoy.  The scent lingers but does not overpower.  Ive been reaching for this bottle a lot lately!

The packaging is beautiful: this makes a great gift for a loved one.  This set comes with three bottles of the same scent (one large bottle, two travel sized) and all three are pretty enough to display.  Im very happy!"

361068,4,"Smells great but expensive!"
549340,4,"This is Ok.  Adds moisture but I don't notice any miraculous changes.  I would say it's on par with other under eye serums I've tried.  Everything works different depending on skin type so I would say give it at least one try"

Looking great, I would recommend it to anyone."
222245,5,"Hands down the best and I mean the BEST straightner I've ever used.  I have used both at salons and personally various products both professional brand and common brands and this is by far the best for thick and long hair.  It keeps my hair pin straight under July humidity on Long Island...bravo and so worth the money!"
58069,4,"I really like this eyebrow gel. It is easy to apply and evens out my brows nicely. The one thing to be aware of is the color. I ordered this in the lightest shade: blonde. I have light brown/dark blonde hair, and light brown brows, and the ""blonde"" still is slightly darker than I'd like. For someone with fairer brows, this eyebrow gel probably would be a bit dark. Otherwise it's wonderful and the color issue is the only reason why I'm noting 4 instead of 5 stars."
109010,5,"Great results.  Great packaging.  Great smell.  Great seller."
178328,2,"Does NOT work on my fine hair. I threw the box away so I cant return it."
398366,1,"I bought this at Bed,Bath and Beyond with a coupon-(thank goodness), as it doesn't work on straight hair at all.  It doesn't get hot enough to curl hair that if naturally fine and straight, even with product on it. Waste of money for sure."

360307,5,"It's so handy and will make application much easier. I have shaky hands, and I used to get eyelash glue every where. This tool has just streamlined the process, and it's good quality. I would recommend it for someone who uses falsies regularly"
408094,5,"Really wonderful, non-greasy, high SPF protection that's great for face and body. I use it on my face, neck, chest, and hands everyday as a daily SPF and lotion. It doesn't leave a film on top of your skin like a lot of higher spf lotions, and it's great for use with makeup"
454447,5,"Love it would like to get the Lavender"
322652,5,"I have to say that I am kind of dumb with eye liner pencils. Ive tried many brands when I heard about this one. I loved, they are easy to use, great color and you can draw a thin line with it."
458539,3,"There aren't enough shades of this to match everyone. The coverage is good, but the texture can be hard to work with, and sometimes it can be a little TOO much coverage for the undereye area."
72062,5,"Like the bar soap at home and the other for travel.  They are both good.
almost time for more. Good."
218780,1,"I spent a lot of time researching blow dryers before buying this one and I was disappointed. It wasn't as powerful as I had expected and took longer to dry my hair than with my old Andis dryer.  I am returning it.  It felt cheap and although that made it lightweight, I didn't love the quality."
443376,1,"not worth the hype to me i don't see the difference in buying this and the one from the beauty supply store"
284617,5,"quality very good! but i wait 1 month!"
302847,1,"Do not buy this product unless you are looking for a cheap replacement.
This essence smells like alcohol for few minutes when first used and then turns out into an impossible smell.
I tried to return the item back and there is no option available for returning this so called hazardous item but they suggest you to dispose it accordingly to the state and local law.  I will dispose it accordingly but the problem is that I lost my money. The entire content of the shipping box smells like coming from China, there is no invoice included in the box, no option to contact the seller or to leave the seller a feedback. Very disappointed by Amazon selling trash while instructing me to dispose the purchase as a hazardous item and not being entitled to a refund."

143733,5,"This curling iron has changed my life! I have very thin hair that never held a curl (no matter what products I put in it) UNTIL this curling iron! Also a helpful tip that I never knew: don't curl the very ends! I definitely recommend this curling iron."

10438,4,"The glycolic facial cleanser does what it says in leaving a squeaky clean face. Most notably, I noticed shaving after washing my face with this cleanser felt smoother, less irritating and the hairs were softer.

I've been using the cleanser for over a year and the two reasons for not giving it 5 stars are:
1. There does not seem to be an appreciable lather. While this does not affect it's effectiveness, it takes some getting used to if you're accustomed to rich lathering cleansers or heavy shave creams.
2. I've found the cleanser changes texture over the course of using a bottle unless you remember to gently shake before each use.

Overall, I highly recommend this cleanser. I continue to use it and I'm upset when I run out and haven't remembered to order a new bottle before the old one runs out."
286208,4,"This is my second Ahava hand cream product to try, and while I did not like the first one, I was pleasantly surprised by this one. I may have thought to give it 5 stars but the price and the scent.

The price is out of my reach at just over $28 (at time of this review) for under 4 ounces. I do firmly believe that we should not expect everyone to sell their products for so cheap they can't stay in business or make a profit, but this is still pricey. And yes, I believe you do get what you pay for, but when I ask myself would I purchase this for almost $29, it would not fit in my personal budget.

The cream is thick and a sand-brown color.

The scent is not cloyingly sweet, which I did like, and has a bit of spice scent to it, but it also has an underlying scent that I don't care for and can't quite put my finger on. I'm glad it's not flowery grandmotherly sweet or powdery scented, but wish the spice scent came through even more. It's almost plasticy? Or?

What deserves a high rating is how SUPER SOFT my hands feel. It does take a little bit to rub it into the skin and let it absorb, but my hands feel so amazingly soft.  I'm keeping this by me when I'm writing or editing so when my hands become dry, I'll have it close. I'd definitely use this for travel--it's small enough and concentrated enough to take with me. If not for the price, I would love to rub this into my entire body, and on my feet after giving myself a pedicure, but at this price I'll use it for my hands only so it lasts.

The ingredients list sounds interesting, but honestly it's difficult for me to make a determination on how those things work at a cellular level on our skins. For a hand cream, since we wash our hands frequently (everyone should be!), most of it washes away (unlike, say, a face cream or body cream), so you have the hope that for this price some of the product does its ""thing"" on more than the top layer of your hand's skin before it's washed away.

I recommend if you are looking for a really great emollient hand cream that makes your hands super silky soft and price is not a consideration for you in your personal budget."
115837,5,"I'm a guy and I've found it very hard to find the right hair shaping product for me.  This is definitely one of the best on the market.  I really like how it holds without looking greasy.  I've been using this for quite some time now and have not been disappointed at all.  I would highly recommend this shaping cream."
456567,4,"I found this product to be just fine. I love the brush and product in one applicator idea but found it hard to control the product at first. The dot that comes out on the applicator just kind of globbed in one spot but a little practice with the built in applicator distributed the illuminator right where I wanted it. I used moisturizer to thin it out and I also used foundation on another area. Both worked but defeated the ease of the one step application. Used alone as intended a light touch works best. When I used this on myself I did not see a big difference perhaps because I was in bright bathroom light and critically looking for a difference. When I tried it on my daughter and then saw her in normal light across a room at a party she glowed."
306051,2,"This product is for thinning hair or hair loss prevention.  I have experienced significant improvements in my scalp condition. The conditioner acts as an exfoliant and you can feel the pleasant ""tingle"" sensation.  However, I ordered the shampoo and conditioner duo but received 2 conditioners-Since they are cumbersome to mail, I decided to keep them.  Worth the extra cost!"
561526,2,"Frustrated because I like the product but the packaging has issues.  The spray stopped working with 3/4 of the can left.  Hesitant to purchase another one or even replace this one if the problem isn't corrected at manufacturing."

471086,4,"Overall, pretty good.

Helps tame the crazy Medusa look that comes from having fine hair with a strong wave, but doesn't feel greasy or gunky, and it doesn't have that wet/shellacked look that gels give.

Smell is pleasant -- it's definitely a hair product, but it's not overly chemical or anything like that, and it has a kind of clean citrus edge to it.

The one thing I didn't like is that it takes on a kind of waxy texture if it gets wet (e.g., in the rain)"
273889,5,"Daughter loved it"

184313,5,"I have used products in the MB line for months now and have tried various products including the buffering lotion, silver powder, healing powder, drying mask, special healing cream, and of course the drying lotion.  Out of all of them, I like the drying lotion best and reach for it most often over the rest of the MB line that I own.  As others have stated, it is best used in the evening, since it is not formulated to work with makeup.  Apply with cotton swab and dab on each pimple until coated in ""pink,"" and let dry.  Typically the pimple(s) are greatly reduced by morning, if not gone, which is why I love this product.  For an acne treatment intended for evening use, this is the best I have found.  Kate Sommerville makes a similar product, but it did not work nearly as well, so I would skip that one if you were thinking of going with that one instead.

Please note that this product does not intend to clear up stubborn cystic acne.  MB does not use a one-size-fits-all approach to treating acne, since there are several types of acne that can form on the face.  Rather, they have developed acne specific products, targeting the actual acne you are afflicted with.  If you have cystic acne troubles, use the buffering lotion, which is formulated to help reduce cystic acne. Their website actually has an acne guide explaining each type of acne and how to treat it with their products, which is worth checking into.  Since MB has many product offerings, I suggest completing their skin analysis online and let them send you free samples of what they believe will work for you from their product line."
7918,5,"I've always had trouble with standard foundations finding my perfect shade of brown. Especially during the summer when i tan, i was really skeptical trying Dermablend, but i figured why not. The Professional Cover Creme *with SPF Foundation is the Perfect cover. Even without primer or touch up sticks, this will leave your skin looking smooth and flawless.

It's quite thick however feels light on your skin and you don't need much to achieve your perfect look. The Added SPF30 protection makes it great for sunny weather.  Overall for all of us brown skin girls, this is the color and cover we've been searching for.  I would definitely give it a try, it's worth the extra $$ for the quality."
345313,5,"LOVE!"
303815,5,"This product is amazing!!  I have been using it for almost a year.  It took about 6 weeks to really see the difference.  People can't believe these are my  own lashes.  So much better than extensions because you can rub your eyes and not worry.  I only use mascara for special occasions!  Using this product every night for the first 6 months or so and then every other night keeps your lashes perfect.  I would HIGHLY recommend this - AMAZING results!"

novelty."
143073,5,"Loving this product."
113739,5,"I have coarse, wavy, gray hair (not ethnic).  This stuff makes my hair beautiful.  NOTE: It makes your hair greasy if you use it on dry hair.  When used on wet hair, it absorbs into the hair.  Before I discovered this product, I kept my hair very short because it just looked big no matter what I did.  I could use smoothing shampoos and flat iron to smooth out, but was pretty labor intensive and wouldn't necessarily hold.  I like this because it does not remove the wave, just makes it soft and silky.  I have tried several of their shampoo/conditioner and styling products.  My hair LOVES all of them.  I like it so well that I recommend it to anyone with curly/big/coarse/dry hair.  I am now wearing my hair grown out with natural waves.  It's so easy to fix and I get tons of compliments.  By the way, I am a liscensed stylist and have tried lots of products over the years.  But this is the only one I couldn't live without."

131747,5,"I love this product.  My gray hair has become every woman's nightmare.  It has gotten so thin that my scalp really seems to stand out more than my hair.  I feel so self conscious about my that I feel when people look at me they see my scalp and not my face.  This product fills in the bare spots really well so that it appears that I have more hair. It blends really well with my graying hair."
212773,5,"I LOVEEEEEEEE this flat iron.  I am always looking for the best new thing... it looks like I have found it!!!!!  This thing glides and the results are amazing.  I have just ordered the 1.25 inch as well.  Why?  Just because.  Where have Rusk products been all my life?//  BTW... I ordered the Rusk Thermal Serum as well.  This puts all of the other serums to rest.
My daughters hair is amazing.  Image is 2 weeks post silk press!!"
497060,5,"I have been using it for years however just tried the peel and it was lovely...I have sensitive skin and this product is very gentle I am 62 years old and any facial I go for they compliment the condition of my skin and I live in San Diego (sun country)"
64576,5,"I get a bit fed up with some of the really cloying perfumes out there. Anyone who's ever had to walk thru a mall department store knows what I mean. Better yet is getting stuck next to some ancient woman at a 3 hour theatre show - sometimes I wonder what the odor is they are trying to hide with that chemical embrace.

Anyhow, back in the stone age when I was a bright, young thing, my cousin gave me a bottle of citrus-type perfume by L'Occitane. They no longer make it, and this seems to be the closest that they now produce. It is my favourite, hands-down. The scent is light and energizing, but not overwhelming.

Their lavender products are quite beautiful. Some of the scents they have for men are remarkably nice as well. Pricey, but a single bottle usually lasts me a year or so."
353154,2,"No good"
274558,5,"Have owned different merkur razors and this one is my favorite. The quality is great and this is my everyday razor. I love having it because of the adjustability. It pairs well with the personna blades."
192412,5,"Don't know why Americans didn't make the switch to ceramic nail files. They are so much better! I've got a large one from Germany but it's nice to have a folding pocket file to carry in my purse. This product is targeted for men. Hey, girls, get with it!"
13629,4,"The lotion is kind of watery, but soaks in quickly.  The smell however is strong.  Not sure how to explain it, heavy powder scent?"
409507,5,"That mud is better that all gels and styling waxes all together!"
349454,5,"So easy to curl my hair with this curling iron. Heats up evenly and gives me shiny, bouncy, wavy curls."
466386,1,"I bought this after seeing a few reviews on YouTube and I was also looking for something that would not be so harsh on my eyes when removing my eye makeup. I was disappointed at the removal of my eye makeup :( This cloth works great for removing face makeup but... when it came to removing my eye makeup, which included non-waterproof mascara the first time, I had to really tug to remove my mascara. After the first and second scrub of my eyelashes I went ahead and opted to use my usual remover. I then decided to give it another try with waterproof, just to give it another chance...huge mistake. Along with the tugging, pieces of the cloth were in my eyelashes and eventually onto my eyeball...which of course caused very red and itchy eyes. I was really hoping this would have replaced my usual oil based remover, but sadly it cannot."
359821,3,"Fhi flat irons do not have a long life span.
I had my platform plus for 8 months and it stopped heating up. The light would come on but no heat. I have curly hair and I straighten my hair maybe 5 times a year and it stays at home. So it didn't have any wear and tear for it to quit working so soon.
Otherwise I love this flat iron because it actually helps my hair. It defies humidity, adds shine and locks in moisture.
I could wear my hair bone straight for two weeks without flat ironing it again. I only have to flatiron once."
215383,5,"Love this!!"
535860,5,"This conditioner is the best!  My hair is full and soft after I use it, I absolutely love it."
223557,1,"Not at all what I expected. It's heavy. It makes my hair look dried out.  I used it twice.  Once to try it and then once again to make sure that I had given it a chance.  It is living in the cupboard, unused.  I'm sorry that I bought it. I thought the ion thing was supposed to be good. (The one at my gym (different brand) seems good. The reviews I read on this hair dryer were good.)  I could wait for it to get here.  Now I have a reminder of a stupid purchase."

498979,5,"Best damn razor Ive had in 45 years!  I shave my face & head and have used all kinds of razors, the previous being a triple blade type.  It took some time, especially with my head to avoid knicking myself, but practice makes perfect. It takes a little longer than using a multi-blade razor, but its relaxing & for the first time, I actually enjoy shaving."
239195,5,"Great product!"

36305,5,"I have been using these glycolic pads on my face for months, every few nights.  They are great for removing dead skin and leaveyour skin smooth, clean, and refreshed.  They tingle a bit when put on, and probably aren't good for very sensitive skin."

534928,5,"Great sunscreen my husband loves it because its not greasy, doesnt smell and is organic."
465740,4,"This dryer works well to reduce frizz for my natural curls, and I really appreciate the faster drying time. It's definitely worth the money. The only negative is the placement of the controls. I regularly hit them with my thumb because of how they are designed."
235795,5,"I bought this to replace Este Lauder Verite purely for monetary reasons. Comparing the two, Verite has a creamy, milky lotion consistency I love. Avene's consistency is more gel-like. The sensory experience is not there, however, the proof is in the pudding. I have red splotches all over my cheeks after a severe bout of hives that I assumed were permanent discoloration. With only one use of Avene they were significantly reduced. I have been using Avene twice a day for less than a week, and my face is almost clear. Although Verite calmed and conditioned my skin, the redness was unchanged. Avene wins hands down for performance."
429983,5,"I am truly impressed with this, I never thought it would be this great. Now I'm only wondering why on earth did I wait this long to get a Clarisonic brush!?!"
308063,5,"Thank you sooo much for such a good product. I use NUFACE every day. The primer goes on smooth,does not have an oderand removes real easy.  If anyone wants good contact between face and NUFACE, it's the primer. I rate it a five star. Keep it comming."
327663,3,"May just be me but I feel that when I use this product I want to itch my head all day.  It does work great for texture and a slight hold (the dirty feel) but that is only if you avoid your scalp."
214962,5,"Love this stuff.  I originally discovered this hair spray on a cruise ship....best ever !
It lasts, it's combable, it shines, no residue...a little spritz is all it takes !"

290072,5,"Love the scent. One of my favorite hair products of all time."
328922,5,"Love this stuff!  It's a game changer for my short, fine hair.  I only need to use a very small amount and the body and texture last all day.  Will definitely purchase again and well worth the money!"
401744,4,"Good perfume, this oil make hair very soft/smooth. Good product"
242683,5,"Polish stay on as advertised. A longer dry time but I feel it is worth it. If you apply it correctly it does not chip for at least 5 days."
460436,1,"It definitely hasn't worked for me . I have already put it around eight times and there s no effect at all on my skin. maybe it depends on skin type? It hasn't had any nocive effect either so far."

428997,1,"TBH I'm actually surprised at the ingredients for this product. On the La Roche website they talk about bad alcohol in an article titled ""Alcohol in Skincare: The Facts""

Then I look at the ingredients are there are two types of bad alcohol listed in this product: Denatured Alcohol and benzyl alcohol.

I feel I wasted my money, I'll be sticking with an organic toner that doesn't contain these harmful chemicals."
374596,1,"I bought the item on November and then I went back to Saudi Arabia and gave to to my sis as a gift. However, my sis just opend it and it does not work so she thought that I broght something artifact so because of that it doesn't work. Thee lights work when press the botton. So it basically only a design but the idea of working is ineffective. Also, she went to a shop in order to fix it, but they told her that we can not fix it unless she has a warranty or something. It is really disappointed that I paid over $400 dollars for something doesn't not work. Finally, i was going to upload a video in order to let you see how the product is not working, however, i have uploaded a  consecutive photos from the video so you can see it and believe what I am talking about. I'm just saying think again before you spend over $400."

408227,5,"Update Feb 2016 - this sunscreen continues to exceed my expectations and has not caused any breakouts or acne. So happy I found this!

Amazing sunscreen! My skin is sensitive to new products, especially sunscreen. I've been using this for 2 weeks and haven't experienced any breakouts! Also, I think this is slightly improving the clarity of my skin - it looks a bit less red since I started using this. I highly recommend for acne-prone skin."
221209,3,"I bought this dryer about 1 year ago, and I am already beginning to see it begin to malfunction. The concentrator nozzle does not stay put, and is constantly falling off. This is not a bad dryer for the power it provides, but if you dry your hair every day then don't expect it to last very long. In the end, I wish I had shelled out more money to buy something that offered higher quality and staying power."
311890,2,"i purchased this roller set after borrowing a  T 3 set from a friend for a vacation.  her set was for short hair, and contained (8) 1 1/2 inch rollers.  they heat rapidly when properly placed on the heating pins and gave me a lot of volume which lasted for days.  i have long hair, so when i returned home i purchased the set for long hair.  i like the result, but i hate putting them in.  the long hair set contains 4 inch and a half rollers and 4 inch and 3/4 rollers.  the clips barely fit the smaller roller, but do not fit around the large ones at all.  i spent $20+ dollars for two more of the smaller rollers.  but i still have a terrible time getting them to stay in for the 20 minutes i need to get the set i want.  they literally fall out on the floor.  i thought i would get better at it over time, but the clips just don't contact enough of my scalp to hold the roller.  for my money, the inch and 3/4 size need much larger clips.  i can't see anyone but someone with hip length, thick hair needing rollers that large, and then i still don't think the clips would hold the roller.  all and all, i am quite frustrated and disappointed in this (not inexpensive) set of rollers and i think i'm about ready to go back to my decade old, much cheaper set.  the problem is that i do like the volume i get with the velvet type roller.  the old, knobby ones give me too much actual curl.  i don't think there's anything else out there now, so i just put them back in when they fall out and swear a lot."

122728,3,"just so so. Not as described."
536960,5,"The smallest amount, applied with a good, wet brush, makes a nice layer of soft cream on your face.  It is amazing how little you need to use.  And the shave is so smooth that although I shave everyday I haven't changed blades in almost two months, and don't know when I will.

It seems pricey at 35 bucks, but it is definitely worth the price.  I've tried others, and this is now my brand for life."
416774,5,"Even with fair skin this blends evenly.  Just enough cover for little makeup look.  One of my staples."
291492,5,"I'm very happy with this makeup. Lasts all days and looks good. Doesn't irritate my sensitive skin or cause outbreaks. Will purchase again."
179032,5,"Great product. Holds hair tight and heats up fast. For some reason I thought 3/4 was a bit fatter but that was my error. I can still use it and will definitely buy Hot Tools in the future!"
511682,5,"I'm obsessed with this face lotion. I use it after washing my face each night and when i wake up in the morning my skin feels so soft and hydrated. Its not light, but definitely not equivalent to a night cream. My skin is normal/dry and slightly sensitive."
373919,5,"I bought this product from a department store because I got free shipping....but there is no place to review it and I want to submit a review. I have short, thick hair but it has a fine texture. I am so fussy about hair products and I need them to give my short hair styled texture. I air dry my hair so I use only one product for styling when my hair is dry. I have been using an Aveda product which is great but over time it tends to make my hair stiff. I was already in love with Oribe Hair refresher...the smell is just so amazing and it is like a dry shampoo in my hair. So I bought this mousse...yes it is pricey but I use it as a styling product when my hair is dry. Ok...this stuff is the bomb!!!! I absolutely love the smell first of all.......and I only need one spray (golf ball size) and then just a tad more (I have short hair). It makes my hair soft and super manageable with textured waves (I have very wavy hair)...............this is a major accomplishment believe me because I have tried numerous products and nothing works like this. It is a all in one product for my hair!!! Love it!!!

UPDATE: I used this product now for 4 days....and although I love it it makes my head itch, I am allergic to some ingredient in it so I have to return it. :("
527862,5,"Greatest mens hand cream Ive ever used! A must have for any man who takes care of himself!"
378946,5,"After reading some reviews about inferior product received, I was a bit hesitant when ordering this.  Paired with Amazon's no 2 day shipping and no return's on fragrances, I felt as I was taking a bit of a risk when I ordered this. I can say I'm glad I took the chance. Well worth it. New packaging, full bottle, no issues. I am not sure what caused the other people to have issues, but do not hesitate to order based on the negative reviews. If you receive something other than what Amazon advertised, send it back. You received the incorrect item"
352203,5,"Love it"
399060,4,"This stuff is great.  The smell is distinct, but very neutral.  It smells very pleasant to me.  The hold is exactly what I'm after;  Firm, not shiny, and lasts a good while.  A little of this goes a long way, especially with wet fingers."
167151,5,"I originally saw this item in one of those airplane magazines. Several months later I had an Amazon gift card and decided to purchase this product seeing it as a no loss situation. I have a full head of hair however my hairline has started to thin a fair bit on both sides. At first I had trouble applying the product however after several goes I am happy to say it was definitely a great purchase. The fibers merge with my thinning hair perfectly and it makes my hairline look as thick as it does in the center. I also purchased the hairline optimizer which I would strongly recommend if you have the same type of hair loss as me. The only down side is that it is quite a messy process when applying but its a small price to pay. It takes no more than a minute to apply and you can even style afterwards without affecting the product you have applied."
66572,4,"why the big price change."
326745,4,"These are definitely on the expensive side but the set is pretty nice. The carry case feels like leather and keeps everything together. The scissors are great. The file is good although I wish the tip had a bit of a curve like most other files that are built into cheaper nail clippers are. The clippers themselves are very sharp and clip your nails really well. So well that they don't go flying every time you clip your nails. That's a huge plus. Some downsides to the clippers are that they don't have a built in file for cleaning your nails (not a huge deal since there is a file included in the set) and sometimes they don't stay in position when trying to clip your nails. Also the clippers don't have the best grip. When squeezing them to clip your nails, sometimes its kind uncomfortable on my index finger."
156203,5,"I love this product!! Is good for your skin!!!"
174828,5,"I recently read in a beauty magazine about the benefits and effects of facial spray's so I jumped on Amazon to read reviews to try and find one that wouldn't break the budget and  had really good reviews -  so I took a chance. I am very pleased with this spray --I use I every other day &  especially  when I come in from work and only have a few minutes before I have to rush out again I spray it on my face and then touch up my make up and it just helps me to freshen up.  I also put it on at night before going to bed I put it on and let it dry before using my nighttime moisturizer.  It does not feel greasy at all.  It's very light and refreshing -it has a pleasant rose  sent so if you don't like the smell of roses this is not the product for you. I can honestly say I haven't seen any improvement or change in my skin but  it has not caused me to break out or had any adverse effects either."
71047,5,"Received what i ordered.  This is the best moisturizer i have found for my face.  A little pricey.  But i have yet to find anything better for less money.  Thanks"
486343,5,"This mascara is so worth it. I have very little eye lashes and I can get a real good length with this one easy to apply and to take off. No hassle take off is deal for me because I don't want to loose more eyelashes. I used to buy always Lancme but this one made such a difference I will keep buying it."
75083,5,"Excelent!!! Amaizing"
382586,3,"This was my first purchase of Molton Brown Peppercorn and to be honest was a little concerned reading so many reviews comparing it to a previous version. I realize I don't know what the old one was like but I really like the smell of this product and so does my wife when I use it. Will say though it doesn't seem to last or linger on my skin for very long but that has been my experience with any other other body washes I have used as well. My guess is to make it stick I would be better off air drying over of using a towel but I always seem to be in a rush to get on with my day and don't take the time. I will be a repeat customer."
120551,1,"This did not work for me at all. I have semi thin blonde hair. I was looking for something to give me some extra volume and waves in the summer. I tried to curl my hair with a wand at first and then spray it but that just made my hair matted and crunchy. Awful really."
355284,5,"I get my nails and toes painted once a month for good measure, but I'm beginning to keep a small Essie Collection at home, especially for touch ups when I don't need to spend another 10 on a manicure, or when the manicure tends to chip a day or so after... I have REAL nails, so this is not to offend those with gels, schalack or anything else but real nails just chip faster!!!!!!!!! Great bargain and way cheaper than most retail outlet discount chains, including the shipping, if any at all.  My Key West color!! :)"
483002,5,"I use this 3-4 times a week after washing up from exercise when I don't take a shower. It's a light final layer that just makes me feel good! Delicate exotic floral scent."

Can reapply when hair is dry and gets frizzy or out of control"
375143,4,"After Having kids my hair went from naturally very curly to straight as ab arrow. I had to learn jow to cutl my hair as an adult and until this product was never happy with how they held up.

I found a little curling moose before blow drying really helps my curls last all day.

I read a tip somewhere online that if you twist your hair a little before putting it in the machine you won't get tangled like some reviews mention and that seemed to work most of the time though i did get my hair pulled a couple of times.

There is a slight learning curve with this machine in figuring out how much hair is the perfect amount to get the curl you desire but after one or two times using it i got it down pat.

It takes me about 10 minutes to curl my whole head of medium length hair and then i blast it with hair spray, tussle to loosen the curls and you're off to the ball park!

The Best feature of this is that it will automatically form one curl after another. I fount it to be consistent and escentually effortless.

Your hair is gently pulled into the chaimber where it is then heated and held.

MiraCurl lets you select temperature, time and curl direction, providing the flexibility to form loose waves, soft swirls or defined curls.

It even signals when it's time to release the curl with a beep so perfect results are just about foolproof."
571302,1,"I did not buy this product from Amazon. Bought from a local beauty store. Spent the day at my sons baseball game and it all sweated off on my clothes. Works great as long as you don't sweat. I had already noticed it doesnt stay on as well as other tanners Ive used. Not worth the price in my opinion. Going to have to soak my clothes in Clorox 2 now."
266151,5,"My favorite color of all time from Shellac line!  A gorgeous lavender blue, like a hydrangea blossom!"
49608,5,"i absolutely love this nail polish!  It looks so cool on and I've gotten so many compliments on it. just a tip though, if you want more of the bottom color to show through put on the crackle when the first coat isn't 100% dry but mostly dry if that makes sense."
554131,5,"a buddy turned me on the Marvis. Wanted to try  all the flavors. Jasmine mint is my all time favorite."
372292,5,"Loved this product. Wished it was natural, however, immediately after applying my hair had excellent elasticity!! I was hoping to get a product that will give me elasticity and this one doesn't disappoint! I've used it consistently for a month and it delivers each time. I purchased my second jar from the Ouidad site. Site cost more but I wanted to compare the one via Amazon and it was the same product and result. Hope this helps!"
534726,5,"Good"

361761,5,"This stuff is amazing! I have curly hair but I have a few strands that dry 'straight'. I'm assuming because my hair is dry.  The first time I used this product my curls plumped right up, really couldn't believe how one use made such a difference.  Now I won't use anything else."
53207,5,"Great quantity for value"
430247,5,"I am 65 years old and I have used this product for 2 years now. I am delighted with the results."

542765,5,"Love this brush it is so soft and distributes make-up evenly. Would buy again"
519432,1,"The smell don't stay on you at all"
198256,5,"Product is great - light weight & non greasy. It absorbs easily & doesn't leave a white cast. My make up goes over it without a problem & I haven't broken out at all. The pump also dispenses a small amount which is nice because you don't waste product."
249426,5,"Best thermal guard for the money"
184466,5,"I'm a big fan of skin exfoliation; it makes my skin look brighter and more refreshed and seems to make imperfections less noticeable.  I do occasionally use a scrub to exfoliate, but that tends to make my skin look red - I find peels do a better job with less irritation.

This product is a peel made from (mostly) organic products and it is formulated for Sensitive skin.  It has a yogurt-like texture and a slight ""sour"" odor (that sounds awful, but really it's mild and not unpleasant).  You apply an even layer to clean, dry skin and leave it on for no more than 10 minutes.  The manufacturer notes that you might experience a slight tingling sensation and/or some redness, but that hasn't been the case for me.  After 10 minutes you rinse the product off.  You can apply the peel up to two times per week.

My thoughts:  I'm happy with this product; it works well for my Normal-type skin.  I don't notice any burning, tingling or redness.  When I rinse the product off my skin feels really smooth and soft, though it does feel a little ""tight"".  I use the product in the evening and follow it up with my night cream, so dryness isn't an issue.  Immediately after using the product my skin appears brighter and more even-toned, though whether or not there are any long-term benefits remains to be seen.  I wouldn't expect to see a huge change in hyperpigmentation issues (the dreaded `age spot'!), as I think you'll need a prescription strength product (or laser treatment) to really eradicate those.

Bottom Line:  This product doesn't claim to be a ""facelift-in-a-jar"" and it's not going to perform any anti-aging miracles.  It can however alleviate dull, flaky-looking skin, and a bright, glowing complexion reflects light prettily and overall gives you a more youthful appearance.  Five applications hasn't even made a dent in the jar, so 2 oz. should last quite awhile.

**Update 1/15/16:  I've gone on to purchase this item as I find that my complexion looks noticeably better when I use this product.  Twice per week gives my skin a nice healthy glow, evens out my skin tone and eliminates dullness and dry patches.  I'm modifying my star rating as this has become a 5 Star product for me - I love it!**"
190613,5,"Love it, lightweight and has lots of power. Does tend to get really hot on the HOT setting. Have to switch it to warm once my hair is about 50% dried."
3321,3,"NOT QUITE AS BRIGHT AS I WANTED BUT THE USUAL EXCELLENT OPI QUALITY."
450265,5,"I really enjoy using this product as part of my daily routine. It hold my hair in place very well and gives it a matte look which I really like. If you're looking for a wet/gel type look this is not your product. It is a firm hold but it is not the firmest if that makes any sense. It can blow your hair in the wind but you can restyle throughout the day without having to worry about losing hold. Overall a great product!"

27378,5,"Thank you!"
16795,3,"I had a curling iron years ago that was extra-hot and it seems to me that it got hotter than this one does. Also the cord on this thing is very aggravating. It has a swivel feature but it gets wound tight anyway, in a skinny minute. I'm always having to unravel it and I find that annoying. Other than that, the performance of this curling iron is acceptable."
207277,4,"This is a nice razor.  The parts are heavy and seem to have a great finish that I can see lasting for many years (fingers crossed).  It is made with three pieces and the threading seems very good.  My only complaint is that the handle is a little on the short side for my taste.  Quality product."
550281,5,"Beautiful eye shadow. I use it as a top coat and it makes any color shimmery and gives it that ""blended"" look so its not so harsh. The shimmer is gorgeous, its easy to get just a light shimmer by using a thinner coat but you can also build for a more dramatic look. I love that it takes on any color you put under and just makes it a tad brighter and shinier."
480079,5,"I have been using this as a toner at night, and as a cleanser in the morning before putting on other toners, serums, etc.  I think it does a good job cleaning off the moisturizing products I use at night because I never wash my face in the morning.  I feel like it's a little wasteful because I use it on cotton pads, but the price is not bad, so I don't feel too bad about it, and my face feels clean."

242042,4,"When the polish arrived, it (""crushed rose"") looked a lot more ""bubble gum"" pink than the picture. ..When I put it on,  it is very a purple color. The color is not at all what I was expecting, but it is staying on well!"

554281,5,"I get compliments about my skin every time I put it on. Besides acting as serum, It diffuses imperfections(discolorations, enlarged pores, etc), & works as a minimal foundation."
12118,5,"Pretty color.  As expected.  Creases a little, but lasts.  Its a nice color for a night out when you don't want to go too heavy, but don't want to go totally nude.  It will last me a long time, but I like it."
512030,5,"This is a wonderful leave-in for blow outs at home. It has a light, grassy scent that fades immediately. The texture is milky and liquidy - this is not a thick, viscous cream. It can be tempting to use more than you think you'll need because of it's light texture, but a little bit goes a long way. This product is definitely meant for blowdrying. If you use some in your wet hair just for an air dry, you'll be disappointed. It won't do much for frizz, and you'll have to use a lot of it before you notice a difference. If, however, you're planning to blow dry your hair, you're in luck. Suddenly your hair will be transformed into soft, silky, frizz-free strands. And it lasts until the next shampoo, which is a huge plus for me. I love this product for my thick, wavy hair that gets really frizzy in humidity. I use it in tandem with Garnier Fructis anti frizz serum, saving the Garnier for air dry days and the Klorane for blow dry days. The Klorane does a much better job of protecting my hair from heat styling, which is why I like to have a separate product for that. It leaves my hair silky and smooth and swingy, without residue or any gross feeling. I'm glad I bought it and would definitely get again. Good price, good product, nice scent. I have used Klorane haircare on and off for about 20 years, and it's a brand that I trust for really well made products and reasonable prices."
209675,5,"I had previously tried the Red Sandalwood soap and preshave, as well as the Green soap and preshave. I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.

The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. All but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. I was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. With a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. I was just able to perform my closest-ever shave with this tactic. Highly recommended.

Associated gear: Parker 99R safety razor; Boker Tree Brand straight razor; Escali Badger Hair brush; Proraso Green pre-shave."

528808,5,"I give them 5 stars for handling the return and refund almost immediately when I discovered it wasn't the brush I needed. The product itself gets one star: it's just a foam brush glued onto a stick for $14. That's a little ridiculous. That's why I returned it."
370856,5,"I purchased this with the Biolage Fiberstrong Shampoo and Conditioner as well. I think the products are great! I have extremely fine and fragile hair and have been trying different products for years trying to change that. This line from Biolage is the one that has had the most impact by far. This cream in particular is great. Since my hair is so fine, I have to be careful about putting heavy creams on it or it'll look greasy. This cream feels very heavy and rich in my hands, but once I put it in my hair and style, my hair looks amazing. Soft and strong already! Great product line if you are looking for help getting stronger hair! A little background on my hair: I have highlighted for years, bleached for a year straight (which killed my hair), and use a straightener daily. But this product truly helps!"
27491,5,"A beautiful purple slightly different than their other purple; has more of a pinkish tint.  Zoya always makes good polish."
87994,5,"I love this shade of bright pink from OPI. I love it so much that this is my second bottle of this shade. It's a great color for spring/summer. Although I have worn it in the fall/winter months especially when I needed a pick me up. It looks great on in those months too. It covers nicely with no streaking at all. I hope OPI doesn't ever discontinue this shade. It's that great especially if your a fan of the pink shades."

182209,5,"Love it"
271490,2,"I agree with kimarie. This tanner tends to be streaky. I had to apply it four nights in a row to get any color, and with the expensive price tag I went through practically the entire bottle in a week. And after all that I didn't really notice a significant color change. It's not a product I would buy again simply because I don't like having to apply tanner every night of the week. Bare Escentuals Faux Tan works much better and is a lot cheaper."
434522,5,"If you can get your hands on this palette... buy it.  I waited and stalked the website till it was released and once it was - I ordered it.  It was delivered within 4 days of my order, came packaged in a bubble mailer which I was concerned about... but all the shadows arrived safe and sound.

I own Lorac Pro 1 and 2 and a few other Lorac items.  While I love those, I'm so amazed with the buttery feeling these shadows have (like it's partners 1 & 2) and the pigmentation.  The color range is nice for someone looking to have a neutral palette with some pops of color and I think all around this is a great palette for a starter high end or someone who loves makeup.  I have been using this thing nonstop since I purchased it.

Great buy.  Swatches and more can be found on my blog: http://www.honeygirlsworld.com"

231738,1,"I ordered this because it was a good deal, but it seemed like this was not the same product that I was replacing. The handle gets really hot where the black plastic part is supposed to keep it cool, and the on/off switch broke off almost immediately. I have always been pleased with my Hot Tools products, but this was a miss."
185500,4,"Just like most other reviewers, my package also came with some of the product spilled out. But there probably isn't much that can be done, as when ever i travel, my products don't always make the trip spill free. With that said......
I DO have colored hair, with high and low lights and an overall color, and I just moved into a house a month ago that does have well water, which is HORRIBLE for colored hair. Using the product only 1x so far, it DID take out the brassyness. I use Redken sulfate free shampoo and conditioner (pinkish colored bottle) on a regual basis. So i think its a good product and my stylist did recommend it."
117419,4,"easy to use and better than a lotion or spray.  Had a little of the smell to it like any other tanning product.  Was difficult to cover my whole body with one use but managed to do it."
520085,5,"My wife complained of  dry scales on her feet and some other problems.  So I ordered Dermud.  It worked very well; she was delighted.  So I ordered two more so that she will not run out of it."
39838,5,"Just a fresh fragrance, not flowery or potent or overwhelming.  Love it and have used this for years after trying very expensive perfumes."
314474,5,"Like a few other reviewers, I'd seen makeup artist extraordinaire Lisa Eldridge recommend this before, but had never looked into ordering it.  I'm so glad that I've had the chance to try this out! This is such a nice lotion.

Although called a ""balm"" as part of it's French title, it's a thick lotion that spreads evenly and stays in place. It almost feels like it's matte in texture, but the nice thin about that is you can apply small dabs of it over your makeup without getting greasy-looking.

In this dry winter weather, I get a lot of dry areas around my nose (from frequent blowing due to allergies) and also in places that get red and raw.  (Using Retin-A doesn't help, since it leads to more dry areas.)  This lotion does a lovely job of soothing those red, raw places -- and I love that you can even dab any extra on your lips to soothe them, too.

Great, versatile product!"

138387,5,"I love these. I use these when I'm out or when we've had a bad diaper situation going on because they smell so nice. They are also the most moist wipes I've found. Since they are so expensive we don't use these for everyday use."
266876,5,"Love the color I pickd and  I'm planning to purchase more.  I would recommend this color to my friends who use Nail Shellac.  This product stays on longer then the other product I use to use."

235611,3,"I purchased this product on the advice of a dermatologist who recommended it to use as a great exfolient in combination with an exfolient scrub.  The acids in the lotion took off the self tanner and left me with horrible blotches.  On it's own, it will help with exfoliation, but just don't use it while also using self tanner products."

527159,5,"First bottle to try. Seems ok. I noticed that oil on my face still appears 1/2 in to the day - I was looking more for an extreme matte look without having to ""powder my nose"" and check up on my makeup occasionally throughout the day."
449367,3,"I have only been using this product for a couple of weeks. From the reviews I read I expected quick results and thus far have seen no improvement. However in fairness to this product I am going to give it a couple of more weeks to see if in fact my case required a longer treatment to derive the desired results. I will post another update in a couple of weeks"

64476,1,"Pump didn't work"
191355,4,"Really like this and the sponge that came with. I have sensitive to combination skin. First time I used it felt amazing. Afterwards, it burns a little at first but then it goes away. Perhaps because my skin is sensitive and feels dry after I wash it (directions say to apply to clean skin). I've used it on my family and they feel a little burning sensation at first as well.

After washing my face off, it is a little red and sensitive but goes away. My skin feels very clean and refresh, smooth and soft afterwards. Don't know when I'll use it all though. There's SO much! and i don't believe it expires so it's fine. the sponge that comes with is a great exfoliator and scrubs anything dead or dirt on my skin away."
465701,5,"Love it - dries hair fast.. smooth and shiny. Have a Babyliss - and this is far superior - worth the extra money if you blow dry regularly."
501346,4,"I have very thick coarse curly hair and definitely liked this conditioner. It made my hair really soft without weighing it down. And the smell is amazing! My only issue is that I use a lot of product each time I wash my hair so the small size won't last me long."
138078,5,"so far its been a great moisturizer and it doesnt even smell strongly of sunscreen which is often an issue with these moisturizers."
421484,4,"I was excited that I got the opportunity to try out this Japonesque face primer.  First off, my skin is a light olive tone, so this primer does not come across as ""glittery"" as other reviewers with fair skin mentioned.  It is more of a luminous, pearly look on the skin.  Definitely has pink undertones in the cream.  I would not wear this alone on my skin, as it looks too iridescent, but rather with foundation over it.  I think it leaves a nice canvas for my foundation, but I don't like it as much as my Smashbox.  You do get quite a large bottle (.84 fl oz.) for the price; it seems that it would last a long time."

45318,5,"This iron is one of the best. Compared to others this has the heat settings I needed. I was priced well below what you would find else where."
397836,4,"This is a different type of serum than I've experienced previously. It's a light, white, fragranced cream. I needed more than one pump for moisturizing the face and neck. I applied it day and night and got compliments about my glowing complexion. There are highlighting ingredients that do illuminate the skin and moisturize it. I didn't have any irritation, reddening, just softer, smoother, brighter skin. NO it didn't fade age spots."
258772,3,"I ordered this product based on the good reviews but unfortunately it didn't do anything great!  Just another product to put in the closet along with the others I've tried since TIGI discontinued my favorite product.  I will say that the service and packaging were great from the seller though."
431743,1,"This priduct sucks "

440978,5,"I have not used it yet, but it does fit the Kiss red Handleless dryer. Perfectly."
257064,5,"I bought this during a huge sale on the Philip B. website months and months ago. I had been sucked in by all the hype, and just had to try it. I have very fine, very curly hair, that is also color-treated and dried out. It's prone to looking flat, dried and damaged whenever I blow dry it straight. But, most products for dry hair are so heavy that I end up looking like a hamburger took a nap in my roots--greasy, lank and zero bounce or vitality.
My initial mistake with this shampoo was that I believed a few reviews that stated that it was all that was necessary for gorgeous air-drying results (no conditioner needed). Not true for me, at all! My hair looked like crap. I very definitely need a conditioner, but I only use it for a few seconds--as in, rake it through my hair to detangle, and then immediately rinse it out. Results are perfection!
Russian Imperial Shampoo is for the person who loves ritual, and loves to feel pampered on a totally indulgent level. I'm really not normally a product snob---I use grapeseed oil from my pantry to clean my face, and stock up on 2 dollar Suave lotion, but there are a couple things where a splurge is just so worthwhile! This shampoo is just something else. The scent is glorious, and it lasts throughout the day and into the next. The process is time-consuming; for amazing results, I rub a glob of it in my hands for a few seconds, and then work it into my roots for a few minutes. I rub it in very well--basically, just give yourself a head massage for a few minutes. A lather builds up around your roots, which you then rake down to your ends. I leave it for an additional minute or two while I shave, and then rinse out with cool(er) water. I then just run a dab of whatever conditioner I have on hand through my hair, and immediately rinse.
After showering, I use a little bit of product and then blow dry. And....oh, the results are gorgeous! It doesn't look anything like my hair used to be. It's now bouncy, shiny, healthy looking. The ends look sleek, not fried. The roots look lifted and clean, not greasy. In short, my dream hair.

Yes, the price is ridiculous. I rationalize it with frugality elsewhere, and the fact that this shampoo lasts quite a long time (as it also extends time between washes, which further helps my hair's condition.) Rationalizations aside (because, really--it's still a hundred bucks for a shampoo!), you either love the results or you don't...try and procure a sample first if you're on the fence. No other shampoo gives me such a wonderful result, nor does any other give me such a wonderful sensory experience. An indulgence, yes. But practically necessary!"
553237,5,"Great deal on a great product"
137880,4,"This shampoo is a lot more gentle than shampoos you would be at the drug store. It has a very nice scent to it. I would buy again."
94026,5,"As many of you know the deep, under ground, pain in the butt cystic pimples can just unpack their bags and hang out for months. I struggled with them for years until i got on a birth control that leveled out my hormones. A while ago I decided to get off that bc and on one with out any hormones due to various reasons. My horrible acne came back within a month and I found myself online googling anything and everything to help with all types of acne.  From proactive to scrubs to washes to...you name it... nothing was helping me. I would wash my face in the shower and break down and cry. My face hurt so bad and I felt so ugly! The next day I was looking for cyst medicine as my last effort before I had to go to the doc to get cortisone shots in them. And that is when  I found Mario's buffering lotion. PEOPLE! The reviews say it all. This is a miracle in a bottle. I had a freakin under grounder on the tip of my nose coming in mean and hot and i applied this for two nights in a row and it started to shrink!!!! Please take my advice on this if you are suffering from cystic acne. I use it on all my big under grounders and it dries them right up. This is the real deal."
440410,5,"Use it a lot with 220 volts.  Sometimes I travel to 110 volt country and I can't travel without this curler.  It may takes a bit practice but worth."
380602,5,"Best foot care product available- have used it for years"
484433,5,"Does work! I have very thick, wavy hair and this seems to give it just enough body and bounce and it lasts all day!"
261511,2,"Doesn't last long even the smell is a bit off and does not smell that strong. I think I've gotten an old stock and though it's an original it feels like I've bought a fake because of this issue. Maybe thats why it was on sale to get rid of the old stocks so its' like i've been cheated because perfume does lose its smell over time"
258321,4,"I ordered this cream for both myself and my wife to use. We have not tried or even heard of this brand before. Honestly, these higher-end skin care creams seem almost indistinguishable from each other. French or similar European origin, dermatologists endorsement, slick marketing, pharma-esque packaging, premium pricing, and on. There is nothing wrong with this I suppose, and competition is good for us consumers.

Our initial impression is good. The combination of a broad spectrum SPF25 sunscreen with a Vitamin C/Hyaluronic Acid moisturizing cream makes this product stand out a bit. It seems appealing as a good all-around daily use product and since it covers a few different bases one could almost consider it somewhat of a value in that sense.

The cream is rather light and rubs in easily. I can definitely feel it's moisturizing effect. It has a barely perceptible scent to it which is not at all offensive. I have rather sensitive skin and have not as of yet had any adverse reactions. We will continue using and expand on our impressions.

I like that the tube arrives completely and unmistakably sealed. In order to open it you must first tighten the cap all the way, which seals the nozzle onto the tube and punctures it."
100033,5,"I love this product.  I always rebuy. Gentle but powerful toner. It's hard to find a good toner without alcohol. My staple toner"
262072,5,"Awesome!"
245845,5,"Perfect... didn't have any problems. Went on perfect and shipping was pretty fast. Will buy again. Wasn't too sure if the color was going to be too light but it was a perfect match"
133447,3,"Messy. Closer to black. Not much out there so I use it. I have yet to find the right shade"
303617,5,"It is definitely not for the faint of noses, however. The scent is very strong but the, how do I say, arrangement of it is so very pleasing. I absolutely love it.
That addresses the scent aspect of this wash. Down to the cleansing: I've used it on my hair, face, body with very good cleansing effect. But you will need to moisturize your hair afterward, the wash is that effective.
Jack Black is expensive but is kept in my shower all the time."
328390,5,"I bought this not really knowing on It, BOY OH BOY I'm happy I did, I have medium fine hair & I applied this to the top of my hair & BAM It was thick & I could play my hair on how I wanted It, It goes on fresh & cooling, This stuffs AMAZING, I've told all my friends to buy It & I'm buying more so I'll NEVER run out, I rarely give hair products my feedback BUT this Is a deff must have, LOVE IT, best mistake buy I've EVER MADE, BEST BEST BEST, HIGHLY RECCOMEND, I only wish I knew about this sooner,"
68766,5,"My husband I have been useing Paul Mitchell product for the last 20 + years and I can't find anything better yet. My husband used shampoo 2 for his oily hair for many years, but for some reason local distributors discontinued Shampoo 2. Since then, my husband used all the other bradns, but they weren't working as well as Paul Mitchell Shampoo 2. It cleans oil, leaves natural shine, it does not dry out, hair is manageable, and it's not 'odious' as some are. It's easy to dispense too! Anyway, I'm happy to find them here and we will use it as long as it's available!"
100415,5,"Smells good."
506548,5,"What a difference in 2 weeks of use so 2 shampoos thus far. My hair has found integrity again after hard water at new home. Very much on my must have list."
376406,5,"Love it"
562751,5,"Really great very satisfied"
410019,5,"I love these! I have tried all the colors on my lips and they have good staying power and nice color. The more neutral pinks do look very nice on the cheeks as well. I wish it were a little more portable... I'm not very inclined to throw the whole palette in my purse, but I otherwise am pleased :)"
235974,5,"Works very well.  Mild but cleans makeup easily.  Gentle with a pleasing light fragrance.  Used Glytone for a while with good results for my skin type"
301127,5,"I discovered this Elemis body wash while sailing on a 10 day southern Caribbean cruise on the Holland America Line in March and fell in love with the invigorating fragrance and the way it cleaned my skin without stripping.  The bottle I purchased to bring home lasted two months; I was happy to find Elemis on Amazon and for $8 cheaper than I paid from the cruise ship spa.  Excellent product."
244269,4,"dark green, nice and I have found it stays on well.  Make sure to use the Vinylux top coat and not others"
94965,2,"Did not work on my hair at all and it does not have a pleasant smell."
227483,5,"Love this Bronzer it really does stay all day and just gives a nice glow!"
219527,5,"Happy wife, happy life!"
370841,5,"Matrix Biolage Fiber Strong Cream is great. I've been using the product for about a month and have noticed smooth, silky thicker hair. In combination with the shampoo and conditioner my hair is fuller with less in the shower drain."
565566,5,"Love this product and am very happy to find it in travel size."
299341,5,"Love it! I'm a professional and I like it more than my BaByliss that I paid waaaay more for. Definitely recommend!"
247098,5,"It arrived on time and in perfect condition. It was exactly like the one we were introduced to on our cruise. Does the recipient use it as often as I had intended? No....but that may change."
193735,4,"it is light coverage as indiacated. I personally like a little fuller coverage."
80357,5,"Works as expected"
289915,5,"Great hairspray"
573080,4,"I only gave it 4 stars because i haven't used it long enough.  Can't wait to see if it really works."
33866,5,"Very good shave when used with the Astra Preminum blades. I have tried the Proraso soap but prefer this cream. Nice shave."
394123,5,"product was perfect and arrived as promised"
73875,5,"The Hydra-Cool Serum is the perfect moisturizer, very light and lets the skin breathe.  Love it.  It's definitely cooling, makes the skin feel very refreshed.  Didn't irritate my incredibly sensitive skin.  I can imagine it will be the best in the summer.  During the winter, though, I need a more intense moisturizer, but the Hydra-Cool serum is a wonderful product.  I am using the entire IS clinical acne system, and the hydra-cool works very well with it."
536939,4,"I like Jouer, but I need a lighter shade of shadow.  Bring back Crme the color, not the shadow type."
113538,5,"A good mild cleanser. I use it after microdermabrasion."
536574,4,"My brother liked it , but a little bit strong for his likes."
213689,3,"Bought the primer and top coat to go with this.  It just didn't stay on more than a couple of days without chipping.  I will give it another try.  My nails are very thin, so someone with stronger nails may not have this issue."
136156,2,"too thick and it chips off.  the color was kinda off too.  had to make sure to shake it a lot to even out the red tint.  not impressed.  2nd color I've tried and same result."
362954,5,"Love this product."
142469,5,"Bought this at a spa in Europe and am completely addicted. Never found anything better.  Dryness is gone. Feels like my face drinks it right in. I also use the pro-collagen eye cream with it. Coming to Amazon to replenish. It is the best. You won't be disappointed. Did I mention how I also look younger?"
37867,3,"My doctor recommended this but I have used it before and did not get positive results.  I am giving it another try as maybe I didn't use it long enough but I think that I did."
259049,5,"Love these products!!!"
196024,5,"I have very thick, course hair and live in an area with high humidity.  This product keeps the frizz out and makes my hair so strong."
59150,5,"I love this product, I ordered it after I went to a salon and they use this product. I liked how if left my hair feeling and the aroma it had, so i searched online and since I order everything through Amazon. They had the product and its lovely. Will order more of these products."
380335,5,"Really like it."
263244,2,"I barely could use it one time .... the bottle
Felt empty... I cant give a good review since didn't test it properly."
502463,5,"This product is light, yet effective and does not leave your hair with that crunchy, sticky film."
379016,5,"This is a classic.  Not as mature smelling as most Burberrys; it's perfect for younger men.  People love it and it can be worn year round, from the office to the club.  Warning:  it is fairly sweet so do not buy if you want something musky and traditional.
Added bonus: you can find it for dirt cheap on Amazon!!!"
63778,5,"Ok, this stuff is AWESOME!!!  This helped with all the little tiny red bumps on my daughters arms.  She rubbed in just a little and within a couple days you can see the difference.  I will tell you that once you stop using this product, the little bumps will come back so make sure that you keep a supply of this.  Use it sparingly, you do not need much."
19597,5,"I love this stuff...Its amazing!!! Ive tried a lot of different products on the market. This cleanser has cleared my face really fast & has prevented my face from breaking out <3"
397260,3,"The product works very well, but when I have bought it from my plastic surgeon's office in the past the same size bottle has lasted almost twice as long.  I used it exactly the same way.  Even though it cost a little more at the doctor's office, its worth it if it lasts much longer."
32735,5,"you can't use a shampoo with sulfates in them every day or you will experince hair loss...simple as that!!!!! shampoos, even paul mitchell brand are not suppose to be used daily. Maybe the others who experienced such a loss should try using just conditioner in their hair,(co-wash)instead of shampoo. I only shampoo once or twice a month with outstanding results.."
465764,5,"My hairdresser recommended this brand to me. Very efficiently dries my hair without drying it out. Light. Very sleek. Would highly recommend."
190137,5,"I've been using Moroccanoil for about a month now and I am in love with it! I have fine blonde hair and I was concerned that it would weigh my hair down or make it greasy but I decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did! I recently moved to DC from California and my hair is not equipped to deal with humidity at all. Mair hair is usually so ruined after being outdoors for 5 minutes it looks like I didn't even shower and I have to pull it up immediately. Since I've been using Moroccanoil my hair looks fantastic - no frizz or flyaways. It makes your hair really shiny and smooth. The best part is that it lasts forever because I only use one small dab on wet hair. It doesn't do anything for volume but I'm sure you can use with a volumizing product and it wouldn't make your hair yucky. This is a great buy!"
250249,1,"I bought this product from another website. I bought it because I have dry skin that really needs some rejuvenation and even skin tone. I have extremely hypersensitive and very very prone to acne skin. I had a severe allergic reaction to it. I didn't expect that with Pevonia. My skin became very red and the acne...I cannot describe how bad it became. I have never had such severe acne in my life. After I stopped using it, the redness and acne disappeared.  This is not for sensitive skins. Period."
202123,1,"I have been taking this for about a month and have not noticed a difference,I am losing weight but thats only from my change in eating habits"
464964,5,"I first tried this mascara as a sample in my Birchbox.  I quickly found out how popular it was when I tried to order, and it was sold out both on BirchBox and on Amazon.  I have very fine, sparse lashes, and this is the first mascara I have used that really made a difference.  It is worth every dime.  My lashes look like I have on false lashes when I wear this. Believe me, I have tried them ALL!"
538961,3,"Not worth the price, the scent does not stay in your hair, and it did little to condition my hair"
210553,4,"I was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves. I like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and I am not made of money ya know. As a mass produced soap it's actually really nice. It loads well, though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones. The scent is nice and has some staying power. The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well. A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better. without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti-inflammatory properties."
340706,5,"I LOVE THIS!  I have really big fluffy curly hair.
I have tried many products over the years and this is my favorite. Other products I have used would hold my curls, but leave them crunchy or ""scratchy"" as my ex boyfriend would say. Or with others my hair would be nice and soft in the morning, then by the afternoon, it was just frizzy and uncontrolled.
This stuff is super awesome because it holds my curls all day long and they stay defined and soft.
My only MINOR complaint is that I wish it smelled better.  It smells a little funny coming out of the container, but it doesn't smell weird once its in my hair, still smell like my shampoo and conditioner.
I would tell everybody to try this product at least once.  It took me a few times to find the ""right amount"" to apply so it works right, but now I have it down and love it :)"
307782,5,"Best thing that's ever happened to me"
345715,5,"this is the best hairdryer I've ever used. If you dry your hair using a round brush, this is a must have. I love it!!!"
455449,3,"I thought it would be a better sunscreen as I had read it was one of the best; however, my lips burnt. It was a nice color though."
557054,5,"I love the concept. Hope it works well."
1964,5,"I use mostly natural deodorants now but I always keep this one one hand when I have a big event or just need something extra! Love it! I've been using this since 2007!"
8500,5,"Mine was lost in the mail. But amazon fixed it.
However this is the best for bad skin, USE PRIMER. DON'T SLEEP IN IT! Covers all.. even a black tattoo. Best smoothes with a foundation brush."
295851,5,"As described, and fast delivery"
493784,4,"was a gift for someone"
308688,4,"I am on my third week of using the PMD, and I am already seeing results in the appearance of my skin. I have some discoloration that I want to get rid of on my face, knees and elbows, and this is working gradually.

You really do need to watch the video, read the directions and start off with the blue tip for sensitive skin until you learn how your skin will react to the treatment. If you have really sensitive skin, then this is probably not for you, but I think that if used correctly this will provide excellent long-term results.

You should see some red marks immediately after gliding the machine along your skin, but if it lasts for more than a few minutes, then you are probably being too aggressive.

I bought the starter kit of the cleanser, toner and moisturizer to maximize the results. I can live without the cleanser, but the toner is soothing and helps the skin recover -- it takes away the stinging and redness. The moisturizer is creamy and goes on smoothly without feeling greasy or sticky.

I got my PMD on sale through a deal for Good Morning America Viewers, but even at full price, I would probably feel that this purchase was worth every dime."
247964,3,"This creme is just ok. It smells good, but not what I expected as far as
keeping my heels soft."
419326,5,"Excellent products."
351526,4,"Works great if you have thinning hair it lasts all day!! Great item"
110740,5,"Best tanning creme I have used.  I like the mousse instead of a gel or lotion.  The mousse is brown and you can easily see where you apply.  No streaks and it dries very quickly.  I use it 2-3 times per week for a golden tan.  I'm a ginger with very pale skin and if it works on me it will work on anybody!"
466488,5,"Authentic product, shipped fast and worked as advertised. Takes off all makeup gently and makes my face feel super clean without being dried out."
336896,5,"This is a great product that works and does not hurt sensitive skin. Receiver it quick.  Price is very good."
479414,5,"Love it. I really notice a difference in the quality of my skin when I use it. My makeup looks better, my skin looks brighter and fuller. I'll be using this for a long time as part of my regime!"
173373,4,"I love the smell of this. I'm sensitive to most floral scents, but this is great. I wish it was a bit more moisturizing, but it's refreshing and does seem to help."
138668,3,"Received the brush and was surprised it was red not hot pink or purple. So I ordered another one today hopefully I will get purple or pink we'll see.
If the product is red it should be listed as red I am sure most people wouldn't mind the red but at least show it in the picture."
485212,5,"Love mad lash stays on all day and makes lashes longer my new favorite mascara not surw I will go back to others"
461397,5,"This stuff is the best"

5140,5,"I like to use nothing but OPI for my nails..great polish! "
204466,5,"Perfect!"
486506,5,"The truffle therapy line by SKIN&CO is by far my absolute favorite skincare line. I was introduced to it last year and have been buying and using the line of products ever since. They not only work well, but something about their sweet light fragrance is divine and addicting.

This was my first time trying the eye therapy and I am pleased with how it works on my skin. Unlike the face moisturizers which hydrate and soften the skin, this eye cream ever so slightly tightens and firms. So it gives you a more refreshed, awake appearance. After using this about a week, I find I don't look as tired. And like all the other products from the Truffle Therapy line, is has a light wonderful scent.

If you've tried other products from SKIN&CO's Truffle Therapy line and like how they work for you, this eye cream will likely become another favorite as well. Works nicely and smells great!"
12714,3,"Good, but not moisturising enough for my dry skin."
142374,5,"Love it!"
359788,3,"nice, but no better than what I have bought in the drugstore."
158370,5,"I'm a nurse and wash my hands constantly.  This is the only cream that reverses the cracking and bleeding.  Love it!!"
562641,5,"Like this product because it doesn't dry my nails.  I also like the look of natural polish."
557468,5,"Perfect product for this lazy girl! I spritz it on each brush after I'm done using it for the day and wipe it down. Easy, smells lovely (like roses), and does the job."
96850,1,"spent too much money and it did not work. i ve been using it for two months now. nothing changed. i even used phyto shampoo and serum, seriously ,all of them together, it clearly did not work. i wonder who are these people give 5 stars?? really? it really worked? i mean stopped hair loss or anything? i don't trust reviews anymore. clearly they were fake. this product doesnt help hair loss.  i jumped to Nioxin products."
226067,5,"Fast shipping
Expensive but Wirth it"
34680,4,"Overall an excellent cream at the price. Everyone will love the cooling effect it gives after the shave."
481211,4,"I love Amazon's Luxe Beauty Box. I appreciate it that it steers more towards beauty products and not make-up. I'm 52 years old and spend less time and money on make-up as each year passes. These wonderful boxes allow me to sample several high quality products before committing to the full size. I know returns are easy on Amazon but I'd rather sample a product and then order it if I'm satisfied."
118345,5,"If you like your hair to be straight, non static and smooth this is the one!  My hair is thick and very unevenly wavy and frizzy.  About a dime size amount, work into wet hair, blow dry and flat iron...this keeps my do in place and feels clean, not sticky.  This sellers price was accurate and I will  purchase again!"
429464,4,"works great but I think you can get one of equal quality for much less money"
35015,5,"Iv'e owned only three in my life and they all lasted more than 5 years each with me dropping them multiple times."
311667,1,"I was extremely disappointed!  I spent $100 on curlers thinking it was going to be higher quality than the Conair Travel sets, but these completely fell apart.  The ends came off within a few months. Of course they can't be returned or replaced."
395534,3,"It is easy to use.  I have reddish brown hair with highlights.  I bought the medium brown WOW.  It really makes the gray darker, but does not make the hair look brown.  I think next time I'll dry the darker brown."
455673,5,"This is the bomb ladies buy buy buy especially for my dark skin chickas you won't be let down period!!  When you put this hight light on your face wow very pretty!!!"
15507,5,"Just discovered this product and product line.  Not just for men.  Good amount dispensed each time.  Goes on smoothly.  Soothing."
283834,5,"Fast service and great product. Thanks. This product is easy to use and has great colors. It is fast and saves money when you do it your self."
419587,4,"This is the best self-tanner, in ever. Period. Try it. I have tried everything. This is better than a salon spray."
216978,5,"I ordered Skinmedica TNS Essential Serum from Skincare Perfection.  The product arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I believe this is the best anti-aging cream on the market and the price I received was excellent.  I am recommending this company and product to everyone I know!  I use only the very best skin care products and was really surprised to get a quality cream like this at such a reasonable price!  If you want to turn the clock back try this for at least 90 days and see what you think!"
558319,5,"I have been using Ahava sleeping cream for a little over a three weeks now and I am amazed at the feel and look of my skin each morning. I definitely see a change in the smoothness of my skin and the increased moisture that I so needed. This product is very easy to apply, and a little goes a long way, so you do not need much to cover your face and neck. It is a bit on the thicker side of creams but it is silky smooth when applying to my face and neck and the smell is wonderful. Love the way my face feels when I wake up in the morning now. Another great product from Ahava that I enjoy using and recommend."
367961,3,"Love this product, but when I received it the expiration date is 8/15 which is a few months away. This product can last a year, easily. So i'm disappointed with the seller but not that product"
420278,3,"This mitt is a must have for applying St. Tropez self tanner & its so soft! Downside-After a couple uses the black backing starts to seperate from the mitt. I have been through 2 mitts & it happened with both after 2nd or 3rd use"
557470,5,"Im a makeup artist and this is my go to. Hate how exspencive it is but love the product. Even more than cinema secrets even."
374236,5,"It's worth the money just get it! And U2 can be like a smell good plumber .... No bubba here. No really it's better then I thought and I've also been complamented on it as well. So I will deffaney be buying it again."
513562,5,"This cream is amazing! The cost might be pricy for some and it is a small tube but you only need a tiny amount so it will last a long time. It moisturizers fantastically and it is starting to plump my smile lines. It is good for sensitive skin too. No breakouts at all in fact my skin looks clearer. I won't go without it!"
41181,5,"love love love this product for travel! you can spray on your hair (I have curly hair - moisture keeps it from frizzing) and your face (or other skin) and it keeps you fresh."
306485,1,"I am a super pink kindof girl and was very excited when this came in. However, after trying color over a light shade and I hate to say it.. black.. both attempts failed! this is the worst bottle of OPI i have ever gotten. Color very diluted only a faint hint of color that is hardly distinguishable from the underlying polish. Will not recomend..."
232952,5,"I love this product.  My hair is soft and shine...complements fr lots of people."
64709,5,"I love this razor!  It is heavy buy well balanced in my hand.  It gives a perfect shave.  It may not be for shavers who have no experience with a traditional twin blade razor.  If I can give them some advice... First, go slow.  This is not a five blade speedy razor.  Second, set the razor at the lowest number.  That is number 1.  This less aggressive angle of attack for the blade is perfect to start off with.  Increase the angle of attack number as necessary.  Do not jump right to number 6, as that is for clearing forests and transplanting skin!  If necessary, work your way up the smallest number that gives you the closest shave.  Lastly, this is a pop top razor, not a screw opening.  Pay attention when you pop the top to change, or flip the blade.  Other than that, your shaving woes are over!"
525329,5,"I really like this product! I spray a tiny bit of it in my hand, rub my hands together, and then apply it to my hair.  I have long hair that is slightly on the dry side, and this product smooths my hair, and makes it sleek and shiny."
179238,5,"Love!  Sturdy dryer!"
279819,5,"I bought this product to help clear up the few acne spots on my face I have had trouble getting rid of because they kept recurring in the same place.  This product has cleared up my skin.  Although I do have trouble with drying out my skin and around my eyes and eyelids  even though I didn't get it near my eyes,  I would recommend this product."
85310,5,"Great color."
417420,5,"Great sunscreen for swimmers. Watch out for the SPF factor, they have two different strengths. Awesome product"
537116,3,"I found this product to be exceptional, unfortunately the applicator is completely inadequate and you can't rely on it to work all the time. I recommend L'Occitane Nail & Cuticle Nourishing Oil!!"
233836,5,"The only sunscreen that controls our sun allergy. No more rashes.!! No more suffering!"
489548,3,"My dermatologist recommended this for anyone over 35 for nightly use. I used it for 3 nights (2 pumps/2 pea size applications per night) and the jar is virtually empty. There isn't a way to open the jar to scrape out anymore. I gave it 3 stars because I love the product and my skin feels amazing. But no way am I paying this much for 3 nights of use!!"
342493,4,"I've used this for several years.  Once to twice a week, it helps keep the brassiness from your highlights perfectly.  You need to be aware it is a bit drying so have a good leave in conditioner/heat treatment for your hair before blow drying."
410209,5,"Great value for an awesome product."
437903,4,"I got this in a Julep Maven box and fell in love. It is a thick consistency but absorbs well- a lil dab will do. I feel like my skin looks brighter and nourished in the morning. Despite the thickness, I have never broken out from it and I have combination skin that tends to break out. Its effects are pretty immediate and it's one of those products that you can tell when you stop using it. I love it and will repurchase."
52085,5,"Great product. I use it on my wet hair and occasionally reapply on my dry hair."
527129,5,"used for 15 yrs and it works"
203119,5,"I bought this for my father in law.  He's Scottish and has sensitive skin and he loved it along with the Parker safety razor"
127920,1,"Upon opening my package, the product was covered completely in shampoo. It seems like half the shampoo had spilled out."
30975,5,"I have long, thick hair.  Why did it take me so long to find this brush?  Actually, I had no idea it existed until I read in a magazine.  My hair has THE best blow outs, I don't even need to use a straightener.  For some reason, my hair takes LESS time to dry with this brush.  Buy it on Amazon.  It's expensive on Nordstroms website."
402250,4,"There was some mild tingling when applied.  It is better than most compacts and I like that the applicator is on the bottom and not touching the product all the time.  (The last powder I got didn't even have an applicator or room to put one (?).)  It does cover and even out my skin tone.

The price is a little high and I can get the same coverage from Neutrogena for less money."
478257,5,"Awesome Clipper"
262606,5,"Washes without being harsh. Doesn't dry out my hair, which is very important for curly hair."
27813,1,"This top coat is not worth the money. Go to your discount store and buy their top coat. You will have the same results. My polish chipped within 24 hours of applying the top coat. Armor? huh?"
23971,5,"Toppik gets the job done.  It is easy to apply, does not irritate the scalp, blends well with hair, and is not messy.

William"
65588,5,"I might be a victim of the placebo effect, but this stuff works wonders. It won't stop you from sweating and it doesn't really offer all day protection if you're doing a lot of physical activity that day. However, it works great, doesn't stain white shirts and the ingredient list doesn't contain aluminum."
271713,5,"Beautiful color!!!,!  Love. OPI"
233427,5,"Love this stuff. Good protection and I love the color which blends in nicely when I am tanned. It's think enough to spread easily too."
309933,5,"Light weight. Covers well. Looks good."
484782,5,"Not clumpy! Great volume. I highly recommend."
520253,3,"It's ok.  A bit too much sparkle for me.  I really wish they would bring back the puppy color."
558811,5,"My hair is in terrible condition. Highlighted, over processed blonde hair and this makes it look much better!"
521874,5,"NO breakage unlike other creams. I love it. Its been about 3 wks.  I will be using this from now on, Im really really really impressed. My hair doesnt looked fried. So far best straightener."
351351,5,"I buy this for my husband because I love the smell. Thank goodness he likes it too. Can only buy through Amazon."
423750,5,"I will buy this again, works as expected."
50407,5,"love this fragarance, smelled in a magaxine and i knew i had to have it and your price was great"
427894,5,"Best Hair Product I ever have!"
242777,5,"Great product, great color. I only use 1 coat and top with the Vinylux weekly top coat and it does last a week!"
493132,5,"my best brush ever. I wish I knew it years ago."
448476,4,"Can't go wrong wet-shaving with Proraso!"
461944,5,"I have extremely dry and sensitive skin. I have used this product for 4 days now and feel a huge difference in my skin. My skin is so soft and feels more hydrated the more I use this. It also cleans very well."
359757,4,"great deal."
558545,4,"Like this concealer,color was close to what I have used before. Like that it has a moisturizer on top, but there was no instructions on where to use the moisturizer, lips or face etc"
131847,5,"It's good to feel confident again when you go to work. I hate how my hair started thinning, but after applying this, I was shocked how well it works. It's super easy to put on as well. Just comb your hair, sprinkle on the parts that are thinning / balding, then put some small amount of gel to hold the shape and you're all set!"
555828,2,"Wouldn't buy again.  Stings eyes, doesn't ""melt"" eye makeup away.... you have to really scrub it in and then it inevitably gets into your eyes and STINGS.  There are better products out there for this price.  My favorite is DHC Cleansing Oil - I doubt I'll try anything else after this."
48512,1,"Too big for my hair, had to return for a smaller barrel. Nothing wrong with actual product Hard to judge the size."
182517,2,"Made no difference. Didnt work for me. It did dry my skin in the surface though just not deep enough to dry the cysts."
1563,5,"Wonderful modern unisex perfume. Love it!!"
177845,5,"I like this curling iron. It works great and give me nice loose curls. I've been using it every two days since I got it. I don't use hair spray. I just curl it and it hold up for two days! It have different temperature. But you have to be careful not to burn you self. Every part that is gold, it heats up. 1.5 inch is perfect for loose curls!"
2045,5,"Works VERY well. I use it behind my arms and the small bumps went away!"
302949,5,"Good"
491126,1,"this is one of those luxery items you pay alot for but didn't see any benefit. Its really useless and a waste of money"
243246,5,"Beautiful color"
557713,5,"Great non-sticky paste; smells good, holds well."
252491,4,"I really like this product. La Roche Posay is a great skin care brand. Serozinc helps me with redness on my face and razor bumps on legs. It just feels like plain water when sprayed on and dries quickly. I will definitely repurchase. I have ordered from Apothekary before and had no problems."
339902,4,"I works well, love the results."
432455,3,"leaves hair very stiff"
152466,3,"The smell is pleasant and my hair was smoother but I did notice that it did seem to weigh my hair down more than I would like in addition to having to wash my hair sooner due to the product. I'll try it a few more times though."
126543,5,"Very good! It seems worked!"
569094,3,"Like the pink. The other one not so much. The sparkles leave it feeling rough on top of your nail. I prefer a smooth finish. Not as sparkley as it looks in the bottle. Just average polish I would say."
160402,4,"You only need to use a very small amount.  The product spreads easily and smoothly.  Has a nice fragrence.  Only time will tell as far as the results go but my friend used it and I notice a big difference is about 2 months."
47178,5,"Using this dryer made my wife wonder why she boght cheap blow dryers for so many years.  This one drys quickly and hasn't lost any power in the almost year she has had it.  She already says this will be the next one she buys when this one eventually dies."
25979,5,"Heavy, long lasting, feels good on my skin. Those are the important features. Now it smells really mediciny , and I don't like that. I am an artist so I stay washing my hands and they are or were dry as ash! This is expensive lotion as far as my lifestyle goes but it was worth it."
62469,5,"Love this brand and scent."
423736,5,"Very nice. Lasts a few months if I just use it around the eye area."
29845,3,"it wasn't as minty as I was hoping"
524302,5,"I am over 50 so mineral makeup generally does not work for me anymore.  But I have to say that I love Pur Minerals.  I can really tell that it is good for my skin and it doesn't seem to settle into the fine lines like a lot of other powders.  My favorite way to use this, however, is for travel.  I travel a LOT for work and I just pack everything in this kit and I don't have to worry about carrying liquid makeup.  And it really lasts."
486199,4,"I actually got the color one time when I was at my nail salon and I loved it. I wrote the name down and did some research to get the nail polish. It's not getting the 5 stars because at times it can be thick and streak. Overall, I love the pink foil like color on my toes more than my finger nails. If you are going to get this polish I believe it is better on the toes and last a while!"
439653,5,"Wonderful scent and really smooths my hair!"
466963,5,"No more wasting money on makeup wipes! This does a better job of removing makeup and gives your skin a deep clean feeling without over drying. Must be made from magical fairy dust to be chemical free and still so effect! Soft materials is gentle on eyes and removed waterproof makeup very easily."
499668,5,"Great dispenser"
156337,5,"I've suffered from pesky blackheads for my entire life and have tried everything under the sun. I've seen the most significant results from this product over any other---by a LONG shot! My pores have significantly reduced in size after using it regularly. If the powder is clumpy or flaky on your face, the cotton ball isn't wet enough. I applied it with a barely damp cotton ball the first time I tried using it too, and it was clumpy, flaky, and fell off my face, as well. The second time, I thoroughly wet the cotton ball and squeezed out any access water before dabbing and smoothing it onto my face and things went perfectly. The powder should take on a clay/mud mask-like consistency if you apply it correctly (like the photo I included here). I've also found the best results when I remove it with astringent versus toner. It wipes right off!"
104360,5,"I ONLY use crabtree and evelyn soap, and have done so for years. I like it's scent - not too strong, and I like the way it rinses off without leaving a film. I have super sensitive skin and C&E soaps are one of the few that won't make me turn bright red after use. So I use it for my face, my body, my hands. Highly, highly recommended - all their triple milled flavors."
545406,5,"Ive purchased a couple pucks of the Slush Fund from my barbers at Judes Salon. I have super straight hair and let me tell ya guys.... this gum gives me volume and a chance to throw a little wave in my style. I typically rock a pompadour or a fade style and with a little hairspray and a hair dryer to set it, Im good to go for the whole day!"
453263,5,"If you don't buy another Wen products, buy this one. It makes your hair like silk, and it smells really great."
292713,3,"I have thin, coarse hair and this didn't work the way I was hoping it would. I think this would work great on the right hair type."
548569,5,"Feels like it might be too firm at first but it dries soft.  High quality stuff, worth the $21."
380694,2,"I love the Nantucket Briar scent by Crabtree and Evelyn.  I have purchased and used the lotion and love it.  I thought I would try the shower gel, and was so disappointed when the wonderful scent was almost nonexistent.  In addition, it did not lather well.  For the price, I expected it to be luxurious, and it is a long way from that.  I won't order it again."
154542,5,"Thick is a great product.  It works really well on my fine hair when I use an electric comb dryer."
398522,5,"Works great... however it is rather expensive. Not that you can find it cheaper anywhere else. It just costs more then I thought it should."
352225,5,"If I could give 100 stars, I would. It doesn't leave my hair greasy or sticky. It's like placing baby powder in my hair, but w/ an incredible aroma that remains and has a smile remaining on my face ALL DAY."
359032,5,"Bought a smaller bottle through my salon but found the pricing through Amazon was better.  More fabulous product and better price.  This organic conditioner along with the shampoo makes the hair feel full and soft, has a great fruity smell but not over-powering.  Would use this product again and again."
121799,5,"it's good if your hair is very dirty. It can really add body to your hair, but if you have dark hair it might be a little light in color. I tend to go to this product and reorder it when I m out when the spray bottle brands don't give me the coverage I need to make my hair look fresh."
474578,5,"perfect item. perfect delivery"
496181,5,"The only product that has helped my ingrowns, even after just one use."
70781,5,"I between using my obagi products, I use this product. This product is very gentle on the skin and it smells great! I will continue to order from this company and use the product."
215923,5,"Awesome dry shampoo! (Blow Pro's faux dry is a similar product that has also worked very well for me)! Klorane's non-aerosol gentle dry shampoo is wonderful! Klorane and Blow Pro have different primary ingredients (Klorane uses rice starch, while Blow Pro uses corn starch). I love how effective Klorane's gentle dry shampoo is at reviving my tired, flat hair while still being so gentle on my sensitive scalp! I have eczema and very dry skin year-round, and this product does not irritate whatsoever! I highly recommend it! I also love the non-aerosol version! It can be a little trickier to apply evenly than the aerosol version, but I have found that it lasts sooo much longer! The 1.7 ounce non-aerosol bottle will last me at least 6 months, and that is with me using it almost every day!"
167092,5,"My stylist told me about Toppik when she noticed how thin my hair was getting to be.  She purchased the 0.36oz/10.3g for me from the local beauty supply.  Even with her discount it was almost $25.  But I really liked how Toppik camouflages my thin spots.  Only a couple of people have noticed that there is something different with my hair.  Only one person realized what the difference was, and only because she'd also used Toppik.

Toppik is now a must-have product for me so I started looking for a better bargain and found it here.  I get almost more than twice the product for only a few $ more.

I would definitely recommend Toppik to anyone."
29593,3,"This polish is watery. Way more so then the other colors. maybe its a fake i don't know. I should have bought in store"
448842,5,"Been using for 2 weeks now. Love it!!"
444383,5,"I bought this from another site (Joyus) because I could get it for $100. I've had it about a month now and love it. The temperature control works wonderfully. I have thick hair and it usually takes 30-40 minutes to curl all of my hair with a standard curler. This curler does the job in under 20 minutes. I do hold each curl for about 5 seconds instead of the 3 recommended but I don't think it's a big deal. Love this curler!"
475318,4,"As per my wife who has been testing this eye treatment for a couple of weeks:
This cream comes in a small pump jar that works well. The scent is very mild and dissipates as soon as the cream absorbs into the skin. It feels slightly cooling after applying and that effect lasts for several minutes. While it's too early to tell if this product will have any long term effect, it definitely softened the wrinkles around the eyes immediately, and my under-eye circles are improved after only a few days."
570477,5,"Love it"
407965,1,"This product is so greasy! Your face will look like an oil slick. I just use it for my body now. Wouldn't buy again though."
260257,5,"I have been using this product for over 3 years now and recently recommended it to a friend and she bought it and loves it."
329218,2,"I threw this item in with one of my orders on amazon and when it arrived i was shocked at how small it was, for the $8-$9 i spent on this i guess i was expecting more, its just barely larger than the size of hotel free-bee products.. as for the product itself my wife claims its good stuff.

update, wife says she doesnt like it.. feels ""icky,gross"" when applying.. were returning it."
483447,4,"I really like it but one of the roller does not work.  The inside comes apart when you try pulling it out once it's heated."
401863,5,"Love this conditioner and the entire Amika line. All fabulous smelling products!"
194486,4,"I like using this shampoo because it gives my hair lots of volume. It allows you to nicely style your hair after each washing. It will also allow your hair to feel nice and clean the next day if you do not wash it on a daily basis."
376820,5,"SK-II Essence is magical!!! I will never stop using it!!! My skin tone is incredible and Im getting people seriously questioning my age. (Ive had no plastic surgery, btw)"
119736,5,"I go out of my way to find this conditioner.  My hair is thick and I use a blow dryer and hot iron to style it.  Needless to say, my hair appreciates a good conditioner.  ABBA really soothes and softens my hair, while strengthening it and without leaving any additional weight or residue feeling."
343193,5,"I had Venus Viva treatment, my doctor recommended to use this to cover up the minor and temporary discoloration, I tried all other BB and CC cream, but none of them worked as good as this one. It's light weight, easy to spread and give your skin a even tone."
191266,5,"I've been using this mud mask for over 25 years. It cleans your pores like no other mask AND it helps improve skin texture.
There is NO other mask I would use or recommend other than Borghese Fango!"
47444,5,"Although a bit heavier than other hairdryers, I love this thing.  It dries my hair super fast and leaves it much smoother.  Great product"
494705,2,"Incredibly expensive and seemed to do nothing for my curls whether I diffused them or let my hair dry naturally."
398616,5,"I did not purchase from Amazon because I needed it asap for an upcoming trip.  I bought it from a local retailer and I have to say that it is great for my hair.  I have hair with a tiny amount of body and I needed something to help with volume.  I tried another rotating type of hot air brush but it was worthless to me.  This product works as a curling iron would but is much less damaging to your hair and it is easy to use as the brush tips do not get hot.  It is extremely easy to use even on the back of your hair.  I was able to get my hair done in a very short amount of time.  I would really suggest giving it a try especially if you have limp, hard to style hair (especially in you live in a humid environment.)  Hope this helps!"
269201,5,"I have used this mask before I got it from a doctor I love the image products"
546667,5,"Another expensive makeup item but worth it love it"
146900,5,"Great tool for my hair needs."
118331,5,"I use it daily after showering.  I have thick, wavy hair that otherwise begins to mat and tangle itself.  This product keeps my hair shiny, smooth and healthy looking.

However, it is serum so it is definitely not for all hair types.  I would not recommend for someone with thin hair.  Also, use sparingly, one pump or sometimes even less is all you need depending on your hair type, length, and thickness.  I use a pump and a half for my hair but I have thick, long, and wavy hair.  (my hair is past my shoulders)"
35735,5,"Favorite natural concealer I have found thus far, and I've used a lot of the popular brands!"
424973,2,"So, I saw this in a video on Facebook advertised for ""Extremely pale"" ladies. I do fall under that definition. It did give me some great color, however, the majority of my color was just a facade and it did wash off the majority in the shower. **This was also confusing because the bottle said 1-3 hours to leave it on, and online it says 4-8 hours to leave it on.*** The next day, I did notice I was a bit more bronze than normal *NOT ORANGE* but bronze, which was nice. I had unrealistic expectations when thinking I could advance my skin tone a good 4 shades darker. So, I am on day 4 now. The bronzer has faded completely from my face and legs, however, still apparent on my stomach and arms. As it fades though, it has become blotchy and I am not satisfied with the look.

I don't plan on buying again."
278476,5,"Love it:)"
260542,5,"LOVE LOVE LOVE!! Leaves your hair bouncy, shiney, lovely! I actually don't have to wash my hair too often when I use this and the shiney shampoo. Love the smell. RUSK is my favorite holy grail brand! I also got their flat iron."
129030,5,"Love it. My brother introduced it to me. Works well without oily feeling or weighing down my hair."
350626,5,"Awesome smell and does not irritate like other anti-perspirants"
517779,5,"I have sensitive skin and was a little bit scare, thinking that this product would dry or irritate my skin. To the contrary, i have been using this product for over a week and it is doing wonders to my face. i apply it before shaving to prep my face for a pre-shave oil. After using this product my face has a glow."
471301,5,"I need to use a flat iron with a high temp because I have really thick unruly hair. The max temp is 425 and it's perfect. I had the classic velvet 2 inch chi in the past and it recently stopped working, but unfortunately they don't make them any more so this is the next best thing."
369130,1,"I'm a hair stylist and I have used many different brands, but hands down my favorite is hot tools. When this bubble wand worked, it worked really good. I've had it for only 5 months and it won't turn on at all.. It only comes with a 30 day return policy. Ugh..!"
570124,5,"Beautiful color, remains chip resistant longer than other polishes."
218431,4,"Love thus blow dryer.  It did take a month or so for that awful new smell wore off.  I used my previous baby bliss for 7 years before it caught fire and sparked out."
77887,5,"the product is very good and i 1st used it on  a cruise last year and wanted to continue to use it."
238989,3,"I got this and use it with large glitter nail polish but it doesn't work as great as I hoped it would."
439730,5,"Great product!"
144224,5,"I love this curling iron. My hair never holds curls, but it does now."
84329,4,"Very Good"
115260,5,"My hair dresser at Red Door recommended this to me, to preserve my highlight/low light color. And with blond hair, the color fades very quickly. Generally, I am very picky about hair products, but this is a fantastic dry shampoo. I went 3 days without a normal shampoo, and my hair couldn't have looked better. Very easy to use.. and smells good too. My only complaint is that it doesn't last that long-- I finished a bottle in about 2 weeks. BUT, price is much better on Amazon.. I paid over $20/bottle at the salon. Overall.. I am very pleased with this product and have recommended to all the women I know!"
168365,4,"Mango is a little more orange than I expected but nonetheless a very pretty color. I also bought wild rose and liked them both very much. The color is not quite as strong as a lipstick but certainly more than your average tinted balm. There is a mild pleasant scent."
284545,5,"Best toothpaste ever."
24558,5,"Has a really nice and refreshing taste. It smells really nice and leaves a nice flowery scent to your breath. Also makes my teeth feel really clean."
396014,5,"Fabulous product, i have been able to extend the time between color appointments. Best root cover up I have used."
554744,5,"My favorite perfume. So subtle, and not a lot of people have this scent...it's unique and my secret!"
440877,5,"Great product- not oily, feel a difference in my skin's texture right away."
54136,5,"So many compliments"
416139,5,"good stuff."
379437,4,"So far this works great. My only issue is how bulky it is - makes the actual drying of my hair a bit cumbersome. This is most likely user error though."
552571,5,"This is the best shave gel i ever used."
194607,5,"Exactly what my wife was looking for and was not able to buy locally.  She was pleased when it arrived in the mail so quickly."
423718,5,"Excellent eye cream!"
483112,5,"Speedy delivery, rollers work great and heat up fast."
314624,5,"Thank You"
568502,5,"Favorite baby wash and lotion. It smells heavenly."
14996,3,"Not the best option if you've got dry hair type.
You will still need to use another conditioner along with this."
177595,5,"Enfin un fer  boucler qui chauffe trs vite, reste bien chaud et fait de magnifiques boucles en un seul passage!
J'ai d achet un mini adaptateur de prise USA-France  moins de 3 et le tour tait jou :)"
493791,4,"It is my favorite  scent."
401066,5,"Baby bottom skin product alert! So happy with this product."
66522,2,"It leaves a wet crease on the eye lid. Have to constantly smear it during the day. Not so good"
136449,1,"The spa that i had my luxurious mani pedi used Butter. I had the silver glitter. The next day it chipped. I went back to the spa to have a redo. The manicurist that did my nails was out for the day ( so we can't blame her)  I had someone else redo my nails. Next day they were chipped again. I love the color and concept but chipped nails are not to sexy.  She told me that they have problems with butter. in fact when I yelped the spa a lot of clients complained that their polish came off. Perhaps they should switch brands? We aren't here to talk spa just the polish.
There are other low toxicity  brands Like Gabriel out there that stay on and have twice the contents for half the money.
So all in all not worth one star really but I guess the color was nice for the little time i saw it."
455906,5,"This mask is very nourishing and hydrating. I only use it once a month on my natural hair as it leaves my hair too protein loaded and dry if I use it weekly. I'd repurchase it in a heartbeat."
282666,5,"Amazing color!!!!"
433998,5,"Seriously, this is the best box I have received.  It's packed to the brim and the samples are actually a good size!"
285179,5,"This must be my 5th time ordering this lipstick from here! Every time I run out I come back for more:) this is the only kind that I use I love Jane Iredale products! My lips don't dry out like from other lipsticks and the color just looks so nice with my complexion"
63047,5,"great price. arrived on time. love the feel and smell on my face."
510660,5,"Love this color."
65855,5,"This product is great! After the first two uses my pores were clear and my skin tone was more balanced. By itself it can be slightly drying, but partner it with the double duty face moisturizer and you are good to go. Note this is a low lather product so don't over work your skin trying to get something to happen that just won't."
210,5,"feels great and smells even better!"
302107,1,"When I've used this product in the past, the shampoo was a dark brown liquid, almost a henna color. I loved that shampoo and it added good volume to my fine hair.
This time the shampoo is a honey color and I'm not sure why. I've shaken and shaken the bottle in case of settling but the color hasn't changed. I don't know if the formula changed or if it's an old bottle. Regardless I'm disappointed and not certain if I should use it or not."
292419,5,"My daughter has wicked heavy,straight hair and this product gives her volume and waves.  Good stuff!"
352984,2,"I got a super sized sample from sephora with my rewards points of this Juice Beauty Stem Cellular CC Cream. (Enough that I have been using it as my foundation every day for the past 2 weeks.) I do think there are a few pros to this product, but I just didn't like it. And here is why:

Yes, it does give decent coverage for a CC cream. That is the best part about the product, but I can find another product that has good coverage and not as many negatives as this one did for me. I also liked the refreshing and light smell of the product.

Cons: I couldn't stand how thick and heavy this felt on my face. It was goopy and sticky for probably 25 minutes after I put it on. And then after that initial sticky feeling left my face, it still felt really heavy. I can't stand sticky and heavy feeling foundations and this was only a CC cream so it didn't even have as much coverage as a foundation. No thank you. I have been using the Lumene Age freeze CC cream and I have been loving that, so I would recommend giving that a try. It's cheaper too."
120731,5,"Love this product. i like how it leaves my hair feeling light and soo easy to manage. the smell is not overpowering and smells like lemons/citrus"
380652,5,"This is by far the softest and most fragrant powder I have ever purchased.  I love it.  This is my second purchase.  I have always loved Crabtree & Evelyn products.  Thank you very much!"
79140,5,"I WAS EXCITED TO RECEIVE THIS PRODUCT.  I HAVE THIN EYE LASHES AND THIS PRODUCT HELPS MY MASCARA TO REALLY WORK WELL.  PLUS IT HELPS IT TO NOT RUN WHEN THE TEMP. OUTSIDE IS HOT.  I WAS REALLY PLEASED WITH THIS PRODUCT...MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR LASHES VERSES NOT USING  A PRIMER.  MASCARA GOES ON SO FAST AND SMOOTH."
271548,5,"Good product; worth the extra money. Not orangey at all...gives you a nice golden look. A little goes a long way too. As far as self-tanning products go, this is the most affordable and most natural looking I've ever tried. This is all I'll use from now on."

317779,5,"So pleased with my purchase.  Delivered on time and in great condition.  Will be placing an order again in the future."
56075,5,"RECOMENDADO"
19952,4,"Been using this consistenly for the past 2 months.  While it doesn't immediately eradicate spots I have noticed it minimizes the appearance (I live in Florida and wear SPF daily).  I will still continue to use this because of my skin's sensitivity to Hydroquinone."
141880,5,"Read others reviews & decided to try it..so glad I did. Great for setting your makeup...feels good."
150701,1,"This ""drying lotion"" did not work well at all for me. I had a few pimples soon after receiving this product and was able to use it right away. It did not dry my pimples up at all after using it faithfully daily for one week. I went back to an older less expensive product that works so much better. For 17.00 I expected a much better product."
185595,5,"My hair feel soft and slick after using it as opposed to the sticky, stripped feeling I have after normal washes in our hard water. This was recommended to me by my super picky hair stylist to combat hard water issues. I use the treatment every other month and the shampoo/conditioner twice a week."
130996,5,"I only wish I knew about this product sooner! My hair has become thinner and thinner over the years to the point where you can see my scalp on the top of my head. I have dark hair and fair skin, so the scalp really stands out. I don't have any hair loss, just a thinning of the hair strands as I get older. I was starting to get self-conscious about it as it would show up in photos and had become so noticeable. I've been dealing with this for the last five years or so, until I found this product. I am very low maintenance. I thought of trying Minoxidil, but the commitment and overall pain in the patootie of having to apply something everyday for a period of time with no guaranteed results seemed fruitless (not to mention the potential for having more unwanted body hair!). I was even considering looking into Bosley, but having hair restoration surgery seemed so over the top (not to mention incredibly expensive). Then I tried Toppik. It works! It takes about one minute or less to apply in the morning and stays put all day. Looks natural. Covers the scalp and blends in with the hair (it needs hair to blend with - this product would not work on someone with a chrome dome). I bought the ball applicator that puts the product exactly where you want it (especially as I like to keep my natural part showing, but use the product to cover the other areas of the scalp I don't want showing) and would highly suggest doing this. I've had no mess in the bathroom ever using this product. You do need to spray it in place, but any hairspray works - you don't need the Toppik spray. I have dark brown hair but use the medium brown color and it works great - I'd suggest going a shade lighter as this works for me. My only concern with using this is that I haven't been out in the rain yet, but am curious/scared of what might happen! Otherwise it stays put, looks natural, and no more going bald in photos! This has become a ""can't live without"" product. I've been using it for over a month now and I can say it's changed my life. Try it!"
114066,5,"I've always loved it and the fact that it comes in a glass nar is great for product freshness. I love the way it smells!"
392033,5,"Love it"
67189,4,"With prolonged use it does seem to make a little hair grow back but certainly no cure for thinning hair. Does smell nice though."
460004,5,"Does not flake!  I have very thick, unruly hair and this has helped the blow drying process quite a bit! My hairdresser also likes it and uses it (now that I've introduced her to it!)"
425900,5,"I love this concealer. Nothing has ever matched my skin tone this perfectly! The packaging did burst open at the sealed end of the tube after about a month and I did notice that the product separated a liitle as I got to the end of the tube. However the results achieved during the main life of the product were well worth it! It blends really REALLY well! I used it when going out on the town for a bachelorette party, and mine was the only concealer that stayed put through the whole night! Just be wary when using on oily skin! it can slide off if not applied on a dry canvas!"
499372,5,"We first bought this in Israel and wish we would have brought home more! Your skin feels like you've have had a treatment in the Dead Sea! A little goes a long way to heal dry skin."
86395,5,"lovely color"
69112,3,"Don't know if I would buy it again.  I say it is not easy to apply because it doesn't go on smooth.  It provides a hint of color, which is OK for daily wear but I haven't used it long enough to explain more."
236741,3,"Well i been using this product but haven't seen any results yet but i'm going to keep using it till i finish the bottle. Hopefully it works for me."
115733,4,"It's great. My hair feels significantly softer and stronger.

I'm only posting 4 stars because I've yet to find it the long-term benefits of using."
129063,5,"My girlfriend's mother works as the manager of an Elizabeth Arden branch and this is her favorite powder."
276092,5,"Recommended by my facial lady. Lightweight, nonirritating cream which I used during my trip to Fiji constantly, no sunburns here!"
361010,5,"Smells amazing. I'm a nurse and they make my sore feet feel soft and renewed."
105034,5,"I have used several different brands of setting powder before receiving this product.  My go to brand for the last year or so has been MakeUp Forever.  I am now a Vichy fan and will be purchasing this brand! I read the description about volcanic water and didn't really expect much but I am telling you this super fine powder is truly correcting and has improved my skin."
156058,5,"Love!"
389866,5,"the best"
86692,5,"Looks pretty on my pale Irish skin."
432691,5,"I tried this at an expensive gift store, but checked my phone and found I could purchase it on Amazon for a much better price!!  Some of the creamiest hand lotion I've ever tried!!"
146754,5,"I bought this product before I read the reviews on it. Most of the reviews were negative and said that this product was a fake and that it this flat iron didn't work like it was supposed to. I was extremely nervous about my purchase after I read these and with good reason, after shipping this product came to $134 and some change. I am not going to pay this much money for a fake.

Thankfully, the reviews that I read, were not accurate! I love this flat iron! It is amazing!! It works great on hair that I have slept on and hair that I have let air dry."
163984,2,"Did not work for me."
400821,4,"Very hydrating works great on neck and face I would buy again."
305493,5,"works"
182427,2,"Doesnt work for me."
159177,3,"I have mixed feelings.  I think this is a good moisture cream but it comes in an
 extremely small jar.
The first time I ordered it, it was only $4.00 dollars.  When I tried to order it the
second time it was the same price. ..but when I tried the third time it seemed to show
that the price had double to $8.50 for the same size jar.
When you're my age 67 yrs young, a small jar just isn't doing it."
473884,5,"This product helps add volume to my thin hair. Love it!"
491939,5,"Love this blush! So natural and neutral enough to pair will all your other eyeshadow shades.
Stays on and leaves a natural glow! Will definitely rebuy!"
335624,5,"I had received 2 small samples of this product from Sephora and after squeezing every last drop I was hooked. My hair is typically very curly and frizzy - the agave oil calms it, removes all frizz and gives it a healthy shine. I hate when my hair looks to greasy or slicked back but if you use just a dimes drop evenly distributed starting at the base of your hair and move up you will be SO happy with the results. My hair is bouncy, soft and smells GREAT. I use this when my hair is damp from the shower - blow dry- than add a tiny bit more to remove the frizz. VERY happy with this purchase. Will definitely buy it again."
417373,5,"Having sun damage, especially when you are aging needs really strong protection. Unfortunately, the best sunscreens contain the active ingredient Titanium Dioxide or Zinc Oxide-they give you the highest protection, but leave your skin a chalky white. I have always worn hats all my life as my fair skin never liked the sun, but my other family members did not and now must wear both a good sunscreen and a hat.

It is worth every cent you spend on a good sunscreen that is recommended by a dermatologist, and our dermatologist recommended this TIZO brand. We were told if you don't see the active ingredient of Zinc Oxide or Titanium Dioxide, keep looking. This Tizo Age Defying Fusion has Zinc Oxide and gives a high protection against the sun's rays, as I burn very easily and I didn't burn at all wearing this in one afternoon. What I like best about this TIZO, is that it is tinted and doesn't leave you looking chalky white. Great protection from the sun's damaging rays and not going on your skin chalky white, makes this a 5 STAR Sunscreen."
457400,5,"I like this...it's much less expensive than the better-known one.  It takes longer to use, each sessions, but I'm happy with the results.  And it's MUCH less expensive...did I say that?"
343502,5,"Needs more scrubbing power."
243686,5,"LOVE this color."
3135,5,"5 Stars because there were no issues & I am glad to get this nailpolish so conveniently through Amazon."
545097,5,"I wasn't sure what to expect as although I've loved everything I've ever tried from Oribe, I associate it more with haircare than with beauty.  Moreover, red has historically not been my goto lip shade and when I have gone red, I have been used to choosing among many shades of red to find the one that it the best match with my personal coloring.  I was a bit thrown by a line that only has one shade of red (""The Red"") and only 6 shades total.

Turns out I needn't be.  I'm not sure if this will be the case with everyone, but I found this shade of red quite flattering with my medium, neutral toned skin and ashy blonde hair.  I have dry lips and also found this to be creamy and forgiving.  It doesn't accentuate lines and when worn over liner I find I can get a few hours of wear out of this.  I definitely wouldn't confuse it with a long wear lipstick, but it's on par with the typical lipsticks I own.  Typically Bite has been my go-to brand for lipsticks but now I'm definitely curious to try other shades in the Oribe line."
543219,4,"Decent cream, thick..."
236002,3,"Almost to thick to force from tub."
475978,5,"Its very runny and tends to drip down my hand and get into my fingers so it's very messy to apply. I do like it though! It looks great on!"
563352,5,"Excellent!"
516525,5,"Great product. Moisturizes really well and though I didn't notice a marked difference in redness, I didn't have much to begin with. Would buy again!"
474686,5,"I use this when I do not have time to wash my hair and it certainly makes my hair look and smell like it was freshly washed"
235663,5,"This has made noticeable improvement in my skin. Not incredible, but noticeable. Happy with the product."
209130,5,"Love this makeup.  It doesn't get oily on your skin at all, all day long.  Super price and lasts a long time.  I'll use it forever!"
19301,5,"This is the softest gel for my hair out there.  It really holds too.  Even my husband uses this as regular gel."
314106,5,"I like it this lipstick. It smells berry,lips after using lipstick perfect."
488223,5,"OK, not really, but this stuff is AWESOME!  Not only do I love the smell, so does everyone else.  I've gotten so many compliments on this cologne.  I swear if I wasn't so ugly this stuff would get me lucky all the freaking time."
12901,5,"great product"
63909,1,"Very disappointed. I thought the Henkel pocket knife/nail clipper and loved it. I thought this would be just as good and it really isn't very good.

I recommend you buy the pocket knife/nail clipper instead as it works great."
290901,5,"Great product - fair price"
572557,5,"After years of hair loss on the sides its growing back. Using Activator and Revitalizer together, going to buy the other products as well. Female, hair loss since mid teens been over 10 years. This works."
312822,5,"Seem to live up to promise & probably better lift than other drugstore products.  So many choices-hard to tell which one is the best."
555135,1,"Dries out hair, does not atomize, most pour out of bottle to use."
260556,5,"this is my favorite lotion, i love it!! the smell is great and i don't have to keep reapplying the lotion every time i wash my hands.. it helps my dry skin way better than other lotions.. i use the shampoo, body wash, and lotion of this brand and i love them all.."
523316,3,"Like all the recipe for men stuff it smells good, feels clean and is over priced."
300658,4,"Really like color but does have some glitter in it and I did not know it did... But looks pretty good!"
427151,1,"It's a fake brush, don't order just go and get your self a real one it makes a big difference on your skin, this brush was enlarging my pores. I went and  got a real one from Ulta and after 3 days my pores are much smaller. So don't buy it."
368572,5,"excellent"
372729,5,"This shampoo is amazing!. And it works great to get rid of craddle cap!. Wish I had it from the beginning."
444334,1,"Had to return it, as the power button stopped working after about 3-4 uses.
Other than that - it makes great waves."
238559,5,"Great product!"
238485,4,"This is a nice spray for misting to wipe your face etc. especially for size and price compared to other brands. If you are extremely sensitive skinned I do not recommend this."
489115,5,"A little goes a long way! Barber Aprooved"
539883,5,"Wonderful kit just for the travel brush, everything else is an added bonus.  Can use the bottles to refill from full sized Baxter products after they are used.  The only complaint would be they shouldn't even have screen printed their logo on the bag because you can't even see it unless you know it's there and are looking at it in the right light; not a big deal unless you are one to flaunt your toiletry bag (I'm sure there are people out there that do)."
22819,5,"I love Toppik! I have been using it for a month now. It gives me enough coverage so I can feel confident about my hair. I use the applicator versus the ""shake on"" method and regular hairspray to hold it in place. This product is basically like make-up and you WILL need to play with it to get the ""look"" you desire."
222055,2,"I am writing from my husbands account. This dryer gets so hot that it fries my hair. My hair is very thick and healthy. I would get a haircut and after 2 weeks of using this dryer I would already have split ends!  And the nozzle is constantly blowing off and hitting me in the head bc the air comes out so strong.  It does dry hair quickly and leave it smooth but at a price!! For me the damage it was doing wasn't worth the time saves."
566268,3,"I have curly hair (type 3B) but found that the other LOVE smoothing conditioner worked much better with my hair, smelled better, etc. The brand is good overall, but I liked the other conditioner better."
504908,5,"I've been getting a lot of cystic acne and I use this to help dry them out.  I've noticed that it helps bring them to a head a lot sooner than if I let them be.  You really do not need a lot of product so this will last a long time. Smell isn't pleasant because of the sulfur but in the end I'd rather have an effective product."
494491,4,"Thinner consistency than desired for a moisturizer, but Guinot has great products"
210875,4,"My wife lost the one I had before this,and although it's not the same as my all Boars hair one I had it's still terrific."
553717,5,"Beautiful. Well worth the cost. Bought as a gift so will know in August."
327709,5,"This does exactly what it says it will do.  The shorter your hair, the better it works.  This stuff is great but even it cannot fight the weight of long hair.
I would buy again."
538286,5,"Great product"
193702,1,"Honestly, I hated this foundation. I get completely done with all my makeup, then I take a closer look, and the foundation cracks so bad, my skin looks wrinkly. Now, I'm only 17. I have clear skin. No wrinkles. This foundation is just not good. I'm upset I paid even $18 while I seen it on sale on Kholes. Makes sense why it was on sale. Save your money & buy something better. Sonia Kasha has amazing foundations, & they're matte :)"
215705,3,"First things first.  If it matters to you, KLORANE GENTLE DRY SHAMPOO - NON-AEROSOL SPRAY (as it says on the bottle) is NOT a spray.  What KLORANE is calling a ""spray"" is actually a bottle of powder that you squeeze instead of shake to apply.  You turn the cap to reveal the opening, and then you squeeze the bottle to force the dry shampoo powder out.  The difference between a dry shampoo powder and a dry shampoo spray matters to me because it is much harder for me to control the amount of powder I squeeze out as opposed to a spray.  I only need a little bit where my fine hair tends to show oil first:  bangs, part, and crown.  With this product, there is no way to apply such a small amount.  When I squeeze the bottle, either nothing comes out or a large burst of powder comes out.  (The main reason I pay more for dry shampoo spray instead of using the much cheaper, but effective, plain corn starch method is because I can better control the amount and placement of product I apply to my hair.)

Also, like corn starch, this product is pure white.  My preferred dry shampoo spray (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rene-Furterer-Naturia-Dry-Shampoo/dp/B000FK4TGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rene Furterer Naturia Dry Shampoo</a>) has a little bit of tint added which makes it look less, well, powdery, even after brushing the product out of my hair as directed.

On the plus side, the product works.  I used this the day after I washed my hair to extend my shampoo, and it definitely eliminated the appearance of oiliness where I needed it to.  Also, to me, this product has a pleasant, but almost undetectable, odor.  (I like the undetectable part.)  I had to bring the hair up to my nose to smell it so I could note it for this review.

Like dry shampoo sprays I've used and looked at, this powder contains the requisite usage cautions warning the user to apply only in a well-ventilated area and to be careful not to inhale the product.  The warnings are another reason I prefer to use a spray.  A spray is MUCH easier for me to control, both the amount and placement of application.

While this product is effective and smells right, it won't replace my current dry shampoo spray."
29625,1,"This is a nice color, but it is sooo watery. Seriously it takes like 5 coats for full coverage, & it gets all over your cuticles despite being careful. Zoya fail!"
500795,5,"Smells like a dream. Got it for my husband. One of my better decisions."
493832,5,"I like this because it holds hair in place without appearing oily or stiff."
36437,5,"Excelente"
53045,5,"Great fragrance, he loved it."
514366,5,"FINALLY....after 45 years, I've something that helps with the static in my hair!  This works great!  And you save a lot of money purchasing the large size!"
526890,2,"I'm not impressed by this conditioner at all. Typically, you can feel conditioners soften the hair while you're showering, but this one doesn't seem to do anything."
118045,5,"I have used this product for years, I love it.  I use it while my hair is wet and it really does help with frizzes and straightening.  I love it and will continue to buy it."
44947,4,"I have owned 6 of these over the years. It was the first hair dryer I fell in love with .  As years went on, I never wanted to gamble on a different dryer, so every time it broke, I would just buy a new one. Recently, mine broke again, this time, the on/off switch (usually, it just stops turning on)...so I once again ordered a new one.  I can definitely say this newer one does not get as hot as my previous ones.  Still love it, but can notice a difference.  I use it pretty much everyday, full well knowing Ill get a year to two out of it.  Still love it though, just wish they lasted longer!"
367122,1,"I figured I'd try something new and more popular for my freshly bleached hair but it made my hair super greasy, almost wax like and more dry. I'm going back to my old brands I used."
555353,5,"Bought as a Christmas gift for my daughter as a stocking stuffer, she loved it"
127228,5,"This product was recommended to me by an spa person.  They cannot keep it in stock.  So I ordered online and it was delivered quickly.  I have shared this product with a few other people and there is a noticable difference in our skin.  THe wrinkles are not as pronounced."
279457,5,"I use this product everyday.  I pair it with Gentle Buffing Creme and Vitamin C, all from the Revision line.  My face is smooth and clear, without redness.  It is an excellent product that makes you feel younger!"
58733,5,"Thank you..may husband loves this cologne and the service was so fast!"
372310,5,"It costs a pretty penny so I only use it on my hair once a month, but if you feel your hair is dry, it is so worth it.  I use this primarily in the winter months to keep my natural curls moist and frizz free. I always use a steamer and leave it in for an hour with a plastic cap on."
201830,5,"This is exactly a perfume should smell when you go to office.  Burberry has certainly hit the correct spot. It is mild than an average perfume which leaves a trail as you walk. This one certainly does not.  My wife loves it . According to her, this might not be a perfume of choice for a weekend but certainly Monday To Friday..."
476070,5,"Bought this to replace my Clarisonic Mia 2 (which I had for 4 years and was very happy with). I can't fork over another $120 at the moment, so I took a chance with this one. It is 100% as good as the Clarisonic. Really the only difference is that it's slightly larger. The brush it comes with is also a little rougher than the regular Clarisonic brush - this one is more like the ""deep clean"" brush. Other than that, it's a fair comparison. If you're stuck between the two, save your money and get this one."

338926,1,"This has a terrible smell"
114030,5,"A nice clean feel after cleansing with this product. Skin feels nice and soft after also. Just a note, use very sparingly...it is very concentrated so it should last for 3 months if used daily!"

476223,2,"Product isn't bad at all if you are religious about keeping it clean. Of course you're paying for the name brand here but the product isn't bad. What is frustrating is that the product entirely stopped charging a few days after the warranty expired. Im not going to repurchase since I can get a similar product for a fraction of the price."

Yes, the plastic squeeze tube is annoying because there is still a lot of cream in the tube after it is too hard to squeeze it out.  Simply cut the tube in half with a scissors and it'll last another week.  I'd rather pay less for this formulation and cut the tube than pay more for the newer Ultra version with the vacuum bag.

*** UPDATE ***
This is a great moisturizer, but because it is only sold in 40ml tubes, it is expensive.

I used, it then ended up buying a big bottle on here.  Not harsh, doesn't over-dry and can be used with a mia 2 with no issues.  Give it a shot."

I have moderately dry skin on my face but every once in a while, my skin gets incredible dry and itchy and uncomfortable. During these times, basic face lotion doesn't work but this one works like a charm! I am a budget conscious person and this is an expensive product but I only need the smallest amount to sooth itchy and irritated skin.

Side note: I do not use an exfoliate if I plan on using this product after; it makes my skin burn. I don't scrub at all but I do use a mild face cleanser. Works great."
396261,2,"It works well, but it takes FOREVER to apply!  It only covers one tiny little 1/4 of an inch of space at a time.  If you need to touch up grey roots in your part, definitely get the spray-on color.  Plus, the spray is less expensive."

I'm proud to say that I left that concert as pale as I was when I arrived.  I also traveled abroad with it and while everyone else was getting tan or burnt, I stayed as pale as can be."

She almost immediately developed a rash on her face and body. The smell is very strong, and it made me itchy and irritated my lips without even coming into direct contact.
I am still leaving two stars since this could just be another product we can't use due to sensitive skin."
464239,5,"I have very fine hair (I would say thin but have been yelled at because it is fine hair, and a lot of it).  In the past, I have had trouble using standard curling irons with teeth because my fine hair would slide right out of the bristles and the curling iron wouldn't grab my hair.  I don't have that problem with this iron.  This iron latches onto my hair without tangling it.  I also like the travel bag and the cleaning tool.  They are very convenient and useful.  The curling iron also allows you to change the temperature.  I've never had a curling iron that I could change the temperature of and I have found that it is nice because I don't feel like my hair is burning like some other irons I have used."

347214,5,"I love this stuff. I wear it on its own most of the time. I prefer light coverage and this plus occasionally some concealer (just blended into the bb) is plenty. Occasionally it can be overly shiny depending on what lotion I've used - but a little bit of translucent powder sets it beautifully."
116639,4,"Vichy Id&eacute;al Capital Soleil Autobronzant Moisturizing Self Tanner Lotion for Face and Body with Vitamin E works well over time. It is spring and the long sunless winter must come to an end.  For people everywhere, but especially those covered up all season with ""whiter than white"" legs, shorts are distressing first thing out.  For me, self-tanners provide enough color to allow wearing shorts without embarrassment of snow white legs, while letting me outside starting to get some sun on those same legs.

Having tried mousses, creams, and thinner spray products, with and without ""guide"" color--I have preferences.  First preference, less cream with drier application.  Second preference, low fragrance. Third, enough DHA concentration to push the first application on the skin to a retained color without relying on the color that literally washes away.  If you have never used these types of products, the longer you can leave it one before you wash it off, the more color you may retain.  As for color, in these products, DHA is the active ingredient and it usually is retained as a brown-orange color on lighter skin types.  If there is added color, and you choose to keep the product on without washing, then that might be a factor in your own product selection.  (In that category, I really like the Fake Bake products, thin consistency but high DHA and lots of brown colorant).

Vichy Id&eacute;al Capital is a cream.  It can go on thick and remain sticky depending on how much you apply.  Too much and it will stay moist.  Just enough and it dries to stay on longer for better retention.  It does not have any added color, so it will not be immediately obvious until later how much tan color you may have retained. The fragrance is OK, not overwhelming, and it does seem to subside over hours, although not totally.

On the first application, I was a bit disappointed with the amount of color provided after letting it stay on about 8 hours then washing it off in a shower.  The second application provided a bit more color. From my experience with other tanners I would say the concentration of DHA is average, not providing a quick tan, and requiring an additional next day application.

Cost wise, and accounting for the amount of product required for coverage on legs alone, I was able to use the given amount about 5 times over a period of weeks.  For retention and continuation of the tan color you need to put it on (and let it stay on for a number of hours) about every 3-4 days.

All of these products say you can put them on your face, although I would hesitate about doing that without trying some on your hands first.  It is not so much about skin sensitivity (and the Vichy Id&eacute;al Capital did not irritate my skin at all, as they indicate) but strange or inconsistent color.  Inherently a cream will provide easier and more consistent coverage than a thinner liquid product, but still-- try it on the top of your hands or upper arms first to see if you like the color that might be retained on your face. (I prefer no face application).

So how does Vichy Id&eacute;al Capital self tanner stack up.  I would give it 4/5, mostly due to ease of application and how it feels after it has been on a while.  Minus a star for perceived lower DHA concentration and slower tan development.

Vichy Id&eacute;al Capital Soleil Autobronzant Moisturizing Self Tanner Lotion can ease the transition to comfortable display of winter legs to summer short weather.  If you have never used a self-tanner this is a good one, and worth a try, especially if you have tried other products."
400085,5,"Just what you'd expect from The Balm. Nice quality."
216103,2,"I was going to use the entire bottle before I posted my review but I'm already having problems so here it is. First thing I noticed was how cheap the packaging is. Normally that doesn't bother me too much since I'd rather be paying for what's in the bottle than what's outside of it but this packaging is a problem. It's supposed to dispense a red liquid and a white liquid in equal amounts when you press down on the pump however after only a couple weeks it only dispenses the red liquid now. I have to try to cover the red hole and push it down again to get any of the white liquid to come out which makes a big mess and usually just gives me twice as much red as white. It's really annoying. I've cleaned out the tube and everything thinking that maybe it was blocked but it's not. I don't know if the pump dispenser inside the white side came loose but it's not like I've been rough on this bottle or anything. It goes in my drawer and out of my drawer and that's it. As for what it's done for my skin, I'm not really sure I see a huge difference. It's nice and I do like the way it feels on my skin but I can't really see any huge benefits, certainly not any that justify the cost and the crummy packaging. Maybe my skin feels a little plumper but I can't really be sure if that's when this product or just my general skin care routine. I might consider trying this again if they changed the packaging but I can't recommend it as is."

228192,1,"This is not the color (London) shown on the models.  The color looked wrong in hand but I thought maybe it would look like it is represented online once I put it on.  Nope.  I looked like a clown.  The color is a garish orange red.  It is very bright & looks utterly ridiculous.  I guess this color might work if you have dark skin, but if you are fair you will probably want to avoid this.  I showed my husband & he agreed with me 100% that I looked like a clown.  I tossed this in the trash, it's not like I can give it away.  What a waste!
Regarding the feel for the short amount of time I was wearing it, it went on super smooth.  It did not feather at all.  As it dried it became more of a matte so it started to feel dry.  My overall impression is that this will dry out the lips.
I know this isn't exactly the same type of lip product, but I recently tried&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Neutrogena-Moisturesmooth-Color-Sticks/dp/B00ADRH0O4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Neutrogena Moisturesmooth Color Sticks</a>&nbsp;in Plum Perfect & Rich Raisin.

I definitely think this hairdryer is worth the extra few dollars!"

87681,4,"I love Opi products, I can't even tell you how many bottles I own. Pink is my favorite color so I have countless variations of it. I did not like this color as much as I thought I would. It's too light, even with muliple coats. It's a got a real creamy bubble gum pink look to it. I prefer either a natural pink or a dark pink. It has a very youthful look to it. The quality of course is that of all Opi. Goes on smoothly and starts chipping about a week after I apply it."
573341,2,"I'd been using a cleansing oil from Neutrogena that performs relatively well, but I was on the hunt for something better--something that would remove makeup, not strip all of the moisture out of my skin, and most importantly, would not make my sensitive skin break out.

It is kind of disconcerting to see that the product so thoroughly (and quickly) separates, though that is remedied by a good shaking.

I very much appreciate that the product is virtually scentless, since heavily fragranced products tend to be pore-clogging, at least in my experience.

I've used this a few times and in a couple of different ways, at this point: First, I tried to use it in a manner that followed the directions, in terms of putting the oil on a cotton ball and going from there. The problem I had with that was that it felt as though too much of the product soaked into the cotton, and not enough made its way onto my face. On subsequent uses, I just decided to put the oil in my hands and then massage it all over my face, concentrating on my eye area, and using that method was a double-edged sword: it did a better job, but far too much of the oil had to be used.

In terms of performance, it's not great, but it's okay. It removes face makeup relatively well, but it struggles to take off mascara and eyeliner. I have to make at least two full, lengthy passes over my eyes whenever I use this, and even then, it leaves so much residue under my eyes and on my lashes, and the eye makeup that I use isn't even waterproof.

Here are the reasons that this product is not so great: even after wiping the excess off of my face (using tissue or toilet paper) and rinsing with warm water, it leaves so much oil behind that my skin feels way too greasy. Even after I go back in and use a cleanser, a lot of that residue remains and it's not pleasant. Making matters worse is that after each time I've used this, I've broken out.

I'm just not a fan of this product because of how it makes my skin feel afterward, how little of my eye makeup it removes, and the fact that it clogs my pores like nobody's business. Adding insult to injury is the price, which is patently outrageous.  I just cannot recommend this, because there are so many better-performing products out there at a fraction of this price."
303965,5,"This product is amazing and highly recommend.  I have used this for 6 weeks and I cannot believe the growth.  My lashes were damaged from using the eye curler.  It is expensive but if you want healthy looking lashes this is the product.  I then got a Keratin Lash Lift and tint.  I no longer use an eye curler and my lashes look so healthy.  The product is easy to put on."
553751,5,"Great for removing makeup from eye lash extensions."
463526,4,"I really wish this product was available in more shades. It goes on easily, and the consistency is nice.  Not super moisturizing, but easily one of my favorite liquid lipsticks."
328115,5,"This powder really helps me amp up the volume in my hair. My part tends to go really far back--like to the back of my head. With a few taps of this powder and some gentle teasing, it really transforms any hairstyle from ""cute"" to ""glam."" It's crazy how much of a difference I feel like it makes. The only downside is it makes your scalp feel grimy, but I've tried other powders and they all do that. It's a small price to pay for beautiful hair, and let's face it, most people aren't going to be digging their fingers into my mane to feel it out. ;)"

It`s a not a full jar of the shimmer and i can tell it was used before - as the roll itself is all over the sparkles jell. So It looks like it was used and not full. Also it`s darker color then a fresh shimmer supposed to look. I`m not gonna return it as i need it for my work. But this is disgusting. I paid 23$ for a bad quality product. So this seller is not good girls."
506971,5,"I used this lotion after an aggressive laser treatment.  I waited until I finished peeling to start applying it and only did so during the day and my face has been recovering very well.  I will definitely buy another bottle so I can use it for any post treatments."
92450,5,"I noticed this product at my hair salon. The stylist used this product as finishing touch. And I could instantly see the extra shine. So I bought one bottle.
Ever since I started using this product I can not stop looking at my hair and mutter with a smile 'how shiny the hair looks'. My hair was always dull and dry. This product helped my hair look good and smell awesome.
The only downside is if I use it on conditioned hair my hair looks very flat by end of the day and I don't like washing hair everyday. I suspect my naturally oily scalp, lack of volume and almost straight hair are the reasons behind this. So if I intend to style my hair, I simply wash hair with shampoo (no conditioner) and then apply one pump worth product on hair starting at the tip and working upwards as directed. This way I don't feel the urge to wash my hair very next day.
Overall this is a very good product and a definite keeper."
354520,4,"I have nightmare oily skin that constantly makes me look shiny and feel gross whenever I go out[also in private but I can hide behind the blinds inside]. while I don't think it's done anything for my acne, it's definitely helped with oil! I no longer constantly have to wipe excess oil off my face and my skin is smooth and moisturized instead of greasy and oily. It also helped with pore appearance and skin texture[feels much smoother]. While, for the price, I definitely wish it came bigger or at-least with sunscreen to knock something else off the list. But I'll still definitely get another! It's not a part of my skincare routine.
The only reason I dock it down a star is, while it could be a defective product, when I first got it and I squeezed some out to use, over half of it came out as air?? Good thing I only need to use a little but still.. Literally over half of the bottle was full of air. I'm hoping next time I'll get a more full one and it'll turn out to be a defect but until then it'll stay at 4 stars."

571424,4,"This product is nice and does control any oil that may appear on the face throughout the day. The only reason why I gave it 4 and not 5 stars is that when I put it on with the applicator given with the pore pact, it leaves a bit of a white tint on the face. I've found that if I apply it with a makeup brush this is not as noticeable. If you apply it very lightly, it should help with the white pigmentation on the face."

321032,5,"My hairdresser recommended this product, and I love it! For reference, I have straight, dry, thick, shoulder-length hair. I have a lot of fly-aways and frizz from dryness. My hairdresser recommended using 2 pumps of this product, but I find 1 pump is plenty. After I style my hair, I put 1 pump of oil in my palm, rub my hands together, then start running my fingers through my hair. To avoid a greasy look, I start at the ends and then really work through entire hair, with a final brush near my top part to get rid of fly-aways.

This product makes my hair very soft, and I love the scent! I've been using it for about three weeks and I started right after getting a haircut, so I haven't noticed a big difference in the health of my hair. This product is expensive, but only needing 1 pump means it will last a long time."

64117,3,"The Zwilling J.A. Henkels nail clipper is a beautiful item, brushed SS 304L no doubt, extremely sharp with a well conceived curve to assure maximum length minimum in-cut, nice easthetic transversal grooves, a smart locking system and a nicely conceived elegantly crafted leather slim suite has every ingredient to be a winning design despite the fact of two fairly noticeable flaws;

1) The leaf spring system is a little bit awkward and difficult to maintain in place while in operation, making it a little bit risky taking into account the sharpness of the blades.
2) The locking system is a little bit loose and tricky to get used to.

But despite this issues, on my professional opinion this nail clipper is a nice addition to any man's personal grooming kit, despite the price."
57836,5,"Right amount of perfume for the price. long-lasting, sweet like marshmallows and sugar with a tinge of spice. I love it!"
523597,3,"It was not as effective as I had hoped for the price.  Do not plan to buy it again or recommend it to friends."
234676,5,"Is works for keritosis"
351605,5,"I have been using this product on my curly hair for two years. One can goes a long way because you don't need much at any one time - too much and your hair will be greasy. I use it as a leave-in conditioner often with no other hair styling product and my curls love it."
518144,5,"Having used this for 2 months now I really am seeing a difference.  My skin has always been good, and I have taken care of it for most of my life, so I had a good place to start from, but I am beginning to see the crowsfoot lines fading, the dark shadows fading, and the general quality of skin even nicer.
FYI I am very fair skinned (red hair, white skin, green eyes type of Irish) so not sure how it would work on dark skin, especially African, but it doesn't feel like it's corrosive so might be OK.
You really only need a fingerprint's worth for each eye area, so it is going to last a long time.  In 2 months I am less than half way through the jar."
194884,5,"Great hold. Adds nice piecey-ness to hair. A little goes a long way."

195907,2,"Super small bottle. All it did was make my hair feel sticky. I expect more from WEN. Will not buy again."
428774,5,"Best face wash I have used for acne. I have tried many different types and this is excellent. I thoroughly removes all my makeup and yet it is gentle enough to use on the eyelids to remove eye makeup. Most other cleansers are not good on the eyes but this one is gentle. I think it really helps my acne prone skin. Combined with a dairy free diet, I have managed to clear my skin. I would definitely recommend this cleanser."
25358,5,"I like to use this product in the morning. It's not that good at removing makeup in the evening.  It leaves yours skin feeling clean and refreshed. I would not suggest it for dry skin"
534401,5,"I'm on the 'fair' side, and really love this product.  I don't know whether to categorize it as a 'bronzer' or a 'blush'.  It's more subtle than most bronzers (which I like - no 'fake tan' look), and works well as a blusher, too. I use it year-round for subtle sun-kissed color."
236789,2,"I bought this product to help with my bumpy elbows and back of my thighs and rare end.  However, during the summer I shave my legs quite often.  A lot of times I will shave everyday.  The directions state that you should not use on recently shaved skin.  So I must ask, how and when can you use this product to see results? I tried to use it the evening and even the next day after shaving and was in total pain from the stinging and burning of my skin."

291205,4,"I am very pleased with my HairMax LaserComb. I began to use it 8/31/14. I had bald spots on top of head now I have grown about half inch of hair on top. I use it Mon., Wed., and Fri. religiously for 8 minutes. I am glad I purchased it."
268,5,"This stuff is so good I have to share with the hubby :("
61055,5,"I think it's  a good product. I haven't used it long enough to tell you if it works, but the few time i have used it, in the morning my skin feels very soft."
262497,5,"Great for my 7 year old!! (and mom too...)"
144215,1,"I'm sure hot tools irons are normally pretty great, but the one I received from Amazon was awful. First time I used it I turned it on it's lowest setting, used heat protectant on my hair, and it completely burned off the section I was trying to curl. My hair is still damaged from it, a year later. Just turned on, it smokes from the tip. It's probably a manufacturing problem, as hot tools irons are known to be really great. Just beware, look for smoke, and test it on a very small bottom section in the back first."
312314,3,"I didn't give this product a lot of points because It broke after a while, but I continued using it and it's very moisturizing and when you put it on it gives a light red color on your lips."

203359,5,"Love this lather and smell!  Easy on the skin and I have really sensitive skin."
95355,5,"This stuff is great!. If I'm having a bad hair day, some of this rubbed in is like magic. Used it on a friend's hair during a visit at the beach who's hair became wild after a few days and she was totally amazed. Am buying her a tube."
477561,5,"very good!!!"
149187,5,"Normally skeptical of things like this.  It definetely dries up any spots you have.  This actually has the ingredients of many OTC products.  It works."

119293,5,"Even after one use this stuff makes my hair feel softer. I really do think this is the best heat protecter out there! Smells great too."
37281,5,"Our son has moderate eczema and we've been using this every night for the past year and a half.  Identifying his allergies was the first real step in treating his eczema but this lotion has made a world of difference.  He actually has soft baby skin now.  We tried a few other lotions early on but Mustela Stelatopia made an immediate and noticeable difference.  I would highly recommend it..."
116027,5,"Saves my hair from the chlorine and helped work some of the green out of my hair last summer."
4829,5,"Excellent product."
42496,5,"I use this with my inexpensive CVS power face brush and the results are wonderful.  I moisten my face, put a small dab in the center of the brush and turn the brush on high.  Using almost no pressure, it buffs my face, removes dry skin  (I use Retin-A Micro Gel) and leaves my face soft and glowing.  Just a rinse and pat dry.  Beads in the cleaning serum are jojoba oil beads, nothing in the product to irritate or damage sensitive skin. At 70, my skin is almost wrinkle free and smooth.  This product leaves it glowing and younger looking.  Can't say enough good things about it."
546403,5,"Wonderful."
471891,5,"Purchased this because my stylist uses it on my hair. The shine and the smell of roses is magnificant."
462411,4,"I know I should've looked at the dementions, but in case you're dumb like me this pallete is very small/travel size. Colors are beautiful and still useful."
42741,5,"Despite the unusual  name, this is absolutely the best shaving cream I have ever found.  The thing is, it is not a cream, rather, a silicone solution that takes friction out of shaving."
40864,5,"works great for scrunchy hair styling"
476721,3,"I like the product.  Unfortunately the pump bottle it came in doesn't work.  A shame you buy something and it comes in poor packaging.  I read this on another review!  Vendor take note."
297883,5,"Really soft"
130374,3,"The way it was described I thought it was a rotating barrell but it isn't so it makes it a little harder for me to use with arthritis ,but it does give u a little volume ,not real happy ,Doesnt do what it should for the money"

273462,2,"I'm so disappointed. At the highest setting, this thing gets so hot that you can barely touch the end of the barrel to guide your hair in. I burnt my hands continually, trying to curl it. It has to go back. Was looking for an alternative to hot tools since that one fell apart. Sadly, it's not babyliss."
189381,5,"excellent"
399068,5,"This is the best hair clay I've ever used. I've tried other products and it just does not compare. I will remain a customer to this product."
326589,5,"This is the best quality sunscreen I have been able to find. It keeps your skin protected all day without having to reapply a million times.

The spray as a liquid cream that you have to run in so I don't think the spray bottle is any better than a tube. But the quality of the actual sunscreen is spot on."
14982,5,"I'm using this one the most since its my favorite smell and makes my hair soft and untangled.  Would buy again from this seller since the price was excellent and the bottle is big and authentic."
294495,5,"I like the fact that it has neutral colours as well as bright. They shadows are very pigmented. I got this for $22 when it is actually being sold for $39! I recommend this for anyone that likes neutrals with a pop of colour!"

60978,1,"Didn't really seem to work..."
249894,5,"I ran out of it and tried other products that were less expensive but always resort to buying it again. Both my daughter and I use this everyday . I love it because it leaves my hair looking natural ! It is truly worth the money as it is great!  Light weight, controls frizz, doesn't dry hard and crispy. Not greasy either."
565388,5,"I love this!"
144909,5,"this is exactly what i was looking for. i have a curling wand by Hot Tools already so i knew the brand was great. i love this curling iron. it makes bigger curls which i wanted. and it gets HOT so you don't have to leave it in the hair for long. very smooth too. the cord is super long like my other Hot Tools which is really nice"

98091,5,"I heard it on YouTube that crystal/glass nail file are gentle for nails and easy to use.  I've done extensive research then discoverd this OPI one here.  I have confidence in any OPI products.... I was initially looking for Czech Republic products but I like the classy design of this OPI glass nail file.  It is a nice change for someone who doens't know how to use a nail file and made all my finger nails kinda started to curl upwards with sandpaper files!!!  Because of the price I bought 2, one for me, one for my mum because I feel like pampering her too.  I recommend it if you are on the fence of buying because it makes it easier to file your nails and it's faster because you don't have to go about different angles to make your nails smooth... did I say I am bad at filing my nails?  Now, I don't even need to use a nail clip because this one keeps my nails in good shape.  I am buying two more, so I'll keep one at work and another in my car.  It is that good.  Just make sure you are have a cushion underneath wherever you are when you drop the nail file it won't break.  I am throwing away all the sandpaper rubbish nail files... or maybe I'll just donate them."
313531,3,"A friend of mine recommended this to me, so I wanted to try it.  I don't get much acne, but I do have oily skin.

I've used this for over a month and haven't seen much of a difference at all.  I used this twice daily at first, but now I only use it in the evenings.  Using this on my cheeks with the low setting feels very rough and uncomfortable, so I use it only on my T-Zone now.

Overall, I don't really think this product is worth the money.  I only continue to use it because I bought it.  As other reviewers have said, it does make your face feel ""cleaner,"" but unless you use a lot of makeup and need some intense cleaning, I don't really see the point in getting this.  Maybe this could instead be used for exfoliating other parts of your body..."
389307,5,"Love the product. Used it recently on a trip to Kuala Lumpur at the hotel and was so impressed I bought it and the shape and conditioner. Usually hotel shampoos only work on one type of hair texture but this product especially the conditioer does just that conditions and detangles wonderfully. Its great to use especially since I swim almost every day. Body wash is gentle and smells really fresh. I have all sorts of allergies and find that other washes burn when I use them. This one is great!!"
24592,5,"What a different taste. Now I know why so many people love the brand. Fan already. My husband also loves it."
34510,5,"This is a great product at a great price with Prime shipping. It lathers nicely and quickly and it produces a nice, slick, thick lather. I like to superlather it with Col Conks Bay Rum shave soap. One note though. The first time I shaved with it, the menthol made the shave feel cold. Also, the lather got cold by the 2nd pass and it made my beard really stiff and it was a terrible shave with lots of razor skipping and cuts. I started heating water for 4 minutes in the microwave in the lathering bowl before shaving so it got nice and hot while I'm in the shower. Then I get the hot bowl and dump the water and proceed to lather in the hot bowl. It keeps the lather nice and warm the whole time and the shave is much, much smoother and more enjoyable. I recommend this for Proraso, or for any bowl/mug lathering.

UPDATE 8/30/12

I was informed I was using Proraso incorrectly. You have to let it sit on your face for 2 minutes and it softens the beard. After making this adjustment, I no longer put my water in the microwave before shaving and I get a great shave! It really does soften the beard. It does feel cold because of the menthol, but it feels refreshing. And now that I know I get a great shave I don't worry about it not feeling as warm. However, I do warm my bowl with warm water from the tap beforehand and it does warm the lather a bit before putting it on my face."
257617,5,"The smell really isn't bad . I've used this along with the Luna night oil. My skin was the best I have ever seen it. Stop into Sephora and get a sample before making the big commitment, it'll last a week if used sparingly . A little really does go a long way. For the people who ""threw it out"" because of the smell, shame on you! Do u know how much this stuff costs ?"
519628,5,"love these face creams they smell of dried roses"
430478,4,"There s gives a smooth finish without looking caked on or settling I. The cracks. Don't forget to set it with powder. It has a thick but not tacky feeling."
431426,5,"This is a fabulous product, it was referred by my facialist at a high end day spa. It really works great! And with a prime membership the shipping is free and 2 day delivery.  If you go to the actual Image skincare website you have to pay 12.95 for shipping and it takes at least 4 to 5 days with standard shipping."
329636,5,"Great for Red irritated skin.."
567163,3,"i love this but for the price its a little ridiculous!"
442041,5,"I like the Mango Body -Lotion very much ,also it smells good"
307395,5,"I love this lotion...first tried it during a hotel stay and there was a sample of this product as the room amenities/toiletries.  Very luxurious, leaving your skin feeling soft & supple, with a pleasantly citrus scent that lingers for quite a while. I love it!!!!"

106305,5,"I spent years trying other candles/oils this is best scented candle I ever owned!!!I I've purchased over 30+ in 2 1/2 years... be prepared to get asked about this candle when guest visit."
170619,4,"I use this product with my electric face brush (Clarisonic and similar brands) and find that it does a great job of soothing my skin while I'm buffing off the top layer of skin. I wouldn't use this as a makeup remover or for cleansing in absence of exfoliation of some sort."
239007,5,"Wonderful product recommended by my dermatologist!"
207706,5,"I was first prescribed benzoyl peroxide by an MD to treat my hormone-related adult acne. I searched for a reasonably-priced product and found this one offered by Topix. It has produced EXCELLENT results. For the first several months, I was washing my face with it twice a day, upon waking and again just before bed; however, this led to an overproduction of oil on my face and I would wake up with extremely oily skin. I now use the product only once a day and a nourishing, paraben-free, high quality cleanser the rest of the time. This approach has greatly reduced my oil production and I only get blemishes occasionally now. Any new blemishes that crop up do not last long. I highly recommend this product and brand."
121049,3,"Okey"
528885,3,"This is a nice, moderately priced shaving crme. However, it doesn't compare with the products from ""Art of Shaving"" or Proraso when it comes to lather. With those products just a dab and a wet brush produce so much more lather than Blind Barber."
474829,1,"This caused my lips to be very dry."
13968,1,"This product gave my daughter a rash."
26124,4,"This is a very effective hand cream for men. I bought this for my husband, and he has been using it daily. With the first use, there was a noticeable improvement in his hands. He's not crazy about the smell--eucalyptus, I think. It's pretty subtle, though."
347203,5,"Good BB cream like it."
561449,5,"This fragrance smells great and lasts all day.  Husband very happy with his cologne.  Tommy Bahama Island Life Eau De Cologne is a very clean smell."
246990,5,"I have used this shower gel for years and love it.  Recently, my Ulta store stopped carrying the Vanilla + Bergamot scent and I was panicked that it may have been discontinued!  Thankfully, I found it on Amazon.  The scent is not too ""vanilla-y"", and is fairly light--as I don't like terribly strong/perfumy scents.  Lots of suds, too!"
288033,2,"Good moisturization with no greasiness, but the scent is overwhelming. I prefer to not smell like I bathed in old lady perfume."
468774,5,"By far the best palmade  and hold  that Ive been able to find. I discovered this product at my local barbershop and all the girls love the smell. It literally works for all hairstyles. The larger product that I bought is a steal for the money and Ill continue purchasing"
20286,5,"Love this product for curling or just adding texture to any style. It's an essential."
293273,2,"Does not heat quick..."
429524,5,"super good,  better than advertised"
124414,2,"Doesn't seem to do anything.."
335028,4,"this is the first time i've tried using shaving soap. For reference, i'm 36 and been shaving since i was 14, have a pretty thick beard that is fairly full within a week of no shaving. I've been using Edge Gel products my entire shaving life and have loved them, along with my gillette mach3 razor (previously used the Sensor excel). i decided to try the shaving soap with a badger hair brush to see if i can get a better shave.  This one had good reviews so i tried it.

The shave itself is rather refreshing and just as close as with the Edge gels. The difference is that with the Edge gels, there's a little more lubrication on your skin, so it's a bit more comfortable, especially when the blade is getting older. Also, after your initial pass, you can wet your hands and lather up a little more with what's left on your face, to get that last bit that you maybe didn't quite get as close as you'd like. With the soap though, the lubrication isn't the same. and after shaving a bit more with it, i've concluded that it's a nice change up to get that refreshing shave, especially on days i'm not rushing to go to work. But i'll still stick having the Edge gel in my arsenal."
535589,5,"Good"
357702,5,"Smells so good and works great in my hair"
357699,5,"This is the best stuff!!"
24700,5,"Leaves thee most amazingly fresh, almost perfume-like (but NOT gross) aftertaste. This will become your new favorite toothpaste. I've tried every flavor and this one is the best."
99945,5,"This foaming cleanser really makes your skin feel squeaky clean, I love this line and use this along with the night cream and the rose water facial spray, I was really happy with this line."
387132,5,"easy to use no irritation.  Cheaper than prescription alternative"
64330,5,"Update - Four and a half years after purchasing this blowdryer, it still runs perfectly. Money well spent. I will definitely buy this brand again when the time comes that I need a new one.

After about a week of debating and looking at blow dryer after blow dryer I decided to spend the extra money on a good one. I am so glad I took the plunge! This blow dryer is exceptional. Well worth the price. I have purchased other Farouk CHI products in the past and have never been disappointed. This is no exception.
One of my favorite features is the 'cool' setting button. Once you press it, the air stays cool. You do not have to keep pressing it like other blow dryers. Once your done with the cool setting, press it again for hot air.
This product is a little heavier than other dryers I have had in the past but I got the hang of it after a couple of uses. It dries my hair in about half the time and eliminates the frizz.
If you are ok with splurging a bit, I would definitely recommend this dryer."
413387,5,"This shampoo is awesome. My hair had some brassy to it. I used this and it made my brassy blonde to a grayish blonde that I have been wanting. I would recommend only using this product once every other week. If you keep using it as regular shampoo your blonde will turn gray."
151227,5,"Not harsh on sensitive skin, but you still feel clean. Do give it a go!"
181178,5,"I've always spent around $50. and usually end up replacing them.  This is the only one my hairdresser uses.  One swipe, hair is smooth as silk and straight.  Definitely worth the investment.  She's been using hers daily at work for 5 years so I'm sure I will have mine quite awhile.  A little Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Smoothing serum before and a touch after prevents damage."
85834,5,"This is my favorite polish for fall. Not quite black, more of a dark purple with a hint of finely milled red glitter. It is absolutely stunning!"
95036,5,"Love it"
127953,5,"Darkest tanning and longest lasting self-tanner on the market."
551566,2,"made hair noticably thinner"

518811,2,"It's ok...I thought it would work better. Don't see it lasting"
115992,5,"When I purchased this gel, I got a few others to try at the same time to compare. This one is by far my favorite. The smell is a huge selling point, but I also found that it was effective in holding my hair the way a gel should, without making it feel stiff or crispy. What more could you want?"
72632,5,"This is a great product. I use it at night mostly. I'm 59 and have used it for at least 3 years. It's strength is the vitamin C. If I could afford to, I'd put it all over my face."

190391,5,"Finally, something that actually WORKS!  My hair has never felt this silky or stayed frizz-free for so long!  It seems to be expensive, but it's not really, a little goes a long way.  The scent is very nice, not overpowering at all and my husband loves it:)"

251983,3,"I don't know if I would recommend this curler, because as for me I don't see much of a difference, but maybe it depends on lashes!"
434603,5,"First of all, I think the launch of this product has been awful.  Someone needs to say that.  I cringe when I think of how many palettes were ruined because of the bad packaging.  I was very pleased that my palette arrived very safely all the way to Hawaii.  It was in the same package as when I order a textbook, and there was bubble wrap.  The palette itself is wonderful, even if there are some similarities in the shades.  I'm very glad I ordered this, so keep trying to refresh the page to buy your palette.  I pretty much had to stalk the website, but it was worth it.  This is a great value for the price, especially since I just recently bought the Pro 2 for $42 and this is twice the size."
136753,5,"Exfoliation fixes it all -- it helps my pores appear smaller, it improves skin texture, it keeps my skin clearer and softer... BUT when you're a red-faced Irish girl like me, you can't use harsh exfoliants on your face.  With other cleansers, my face would get red.  And stay red all day!

This cleanser is creamy and non-irritating, but it really does slough off the junky top layer of skin.  It's truly magical.  I'd buy stock in it if I could.

Also, if you care about these things (and I do), Badescu products are cruelty free."
284339,5,"A true classic scent and Crabtree & Evelyn is always a reliable choice. The scent reminds me of walking through Monet's rose garden outside of Paris, when the roses are in full bloom in June. Lovely!"
21822,5,"If your hair is patchy, you need this."
38834,5,"i would not lie, this product is definitely worth the buy"
436080,5,"For anyone wondering if this is the real thing...it totally is! I use it all the time, with wet hair or dry! It really works wonders and rehydrates hair like you wouldn't believe!"
230475,5,"Great to use if you normally end up with mascara from your lower lashes smearing everywhere - no smearing!"
356947,5,"I've been looking for a product like this for a long time.  It left my hair soft and manageable after the first use.  Also reduced frizziness on a humid day and added shine.  The only downside potentially that it has a medicinal/herbal smell which I found pleasing but others may not."
416294,5,"Great product"
452053,1,"This product stopped working after just a few months.  It looks like Amazon is not providing me a way to return it, either."
259079,4,"the sunscreen cream is effective, but I don't like the scent."
540600,5,"Love this product. I use the gel top coat, basecoat, oxygen therapy, and colors."
267469,4,"Bought this color because I saw it used in a number of different layering images with other colors.  I haven't yet done any layering but this is a nice shimmery pink.

This is a UV cured 'gel' polish.  Done properly, a CND Shellac will last 1-3 weeks.

I have softer flexible nails - My nails need polish to keep from breaking and get longer.  Acrylic kills my nails and if a salon does a generic 'off brand' gel polish, they often file my nails making them really damaged and weak so I decided to buy the CND kit & do it myself (also saving me $ in the long run.)  Before Shellac I gave up on polishing my nails unless for a special event because it would peel off in a day. What a waste to spend all that time painting and drying for it to peel away the next day.  I type a lot at work as well as boxing and packing stuff so I am tough on my hands.  Shellac is the best system because it stays on but comes off easy WITHOUT any filing.  It lasts me about 7-10 days on dark colors, because I chose to take it off when I can see growth at the cuticle.  On many others, it will easily last 2 + weeks"
146544,5,"Babyliss is all I will use bc it is a great product for the price! Definitely the best in its price range!"
164877,5,"I always bought the X-Fusion brand of hair fibers, but they are getting harder to find lately so I tried this.  I think the product is basically the same and I'm liking it so far."
181393,2,"Not the real BaBylissPRO Nano.

I have this exact model and type of babyliss straightener before I ordered this one off Amazon. It's a wonderful straightener! However, the one that they sent me was not the same. The color was different. the heat settings were not the same. It felt completely different running this one through my hair as opposed to my other one.

The BaByliss PRO nano is an excellent straightener; however, this is not the BaByliss PRO. I strongly believe that this is a fake. It's still a decent straightener. but don't advertise something that you're not please. People will be disappointed."
433918,5,"I love the colors and the compact with mirror.  There are 6 eye colors, 2 lip, and one blush that creates a natural look...love that. There are step by step instructions but I could not read them as the font was small so I reviewed the instructions on the internet.  I really liked that, as I was never good at applying makeup, so these little tutorials are perfect for me.

There is a small two ended brush that does not fit into the compact which is a shame, and you will need a bigger brush for the blush. I am not sure if this makeup is hypo-allergenic, but my skin did not have any negative reactions. I could not read the label on the back of the compact that explains which color is for what use.

Overall I really like the makeup, compact and video tutorials.  Highly recommend."
265020,5,"It seems to have disappeared from the market. I bought as much as I could find.  Please bring it back.  It's a very pleasant, refreshing rinse that leave the mouth feeling fresh and clean."
188614,5,"I love this product and will keep on ordering it . It's pricey though . The only reason I ordered it was because it's on the EWG  list of safe moisturizers . If it wasn't on this list I wouldn't have purchased it . It's a nice moisturizer , but a lot of moisturizers are nice . So please don't change the ingredients so it will remain  listed on EWG list of safe products to use ."
143148,5,"I have used this product for 3 weeks now, I use it in the morning on my face and neck and arms, feels great."
170457,5,"Amazing!"
160878,4,"The unscented version doesn't smell and it doesn't break me out. This is a good staple in my book, even if it is a little pricey."
120490,5,"I have very thick wavy hair and have never been able to have the straight sleek look, until I tried this product. First, the smell is incredible - pure jasmine oil which calms the hair and during the day when you turn your head you get a lingering scent of jasmine. It makes my hair silky and manageable and unlike other serums I've tried, this one does not make my hair look or feel oily. I highly recommend this product as well as the other Oscar Blandi jasmine line which I use."
335716,5,"I LOVE THIS SUNSCREEN. I do not use it on my body just my face. I spray directly on my face small section by section (though I am rethinking as apparently one can inhale the particles and that's not good). I love that there is no white cast whatsoever. my search for a no white cast mineral water resistant sunscreen ends with this one! Glad it contains antioxidants as well! I do not like applying it like they suggest because it is very watery and I feel my fingers absorb the product before it gets on my face and I end up using more. this is only 40 minutes water resistant though wish it were 80 minutes, but oh well I will take it as sunscreens with no alcohol, essential oils and other irritants, 100% mineral, water resistant and no white cast are very very few on the market. did I mention great value for the cost as you get a whopping 4oz!"
136848,1,"There are Parabens in this product but Amazon posted a picture that did not indicate so thus making this a dishonest & misinformed prdt info, I don't prescribe to Parabens & disappointed with this."
191103,5,"Great product. And, unlike some counterfeit product I have bought elsewhere on Amazon, this appears to be the authentic Paul Mitchell item. Note: if you receive a bottle which contains watery horrible smelling glop - it's NOT authentic. Stick with reputable sellers."
191975,5,"One of my new favs!!"
250234,5,"I have intensely dry, sensitive Irish skin. Whenever I visit cosmetic counters, I always receive the same remark-""Wow, your skin is so dry!"" So I'm always pushed to buy the most moisturizing products I can. Recently I realized that my face cream was not moisturizing enough, and I was still getting dry patches. I've always had dry patches on my nose and cheeks, but I figured that was due to my skin rather than the lotion itself. Wrong!

Once I started using this cream, my dry patches almost entirely cleared up. This is without a doubt the most moisturizing, gentle formula I've used. I left my Clinique Dramatically Different behind for this and have no regrets.

I've bought three bottles in about 10 months, so I do go through it quickly. But I also use it several times a day, and I also use it on my neck and chest area as well. It is pricey, but completely worth it, especially if you have dry, patchy, senstive Irish skin like I do! Plus, this stuff turns my skin from chalky and matte to shiny, glowing, and dewy. I look younger and healthier, so I really do feel it's worth the money.

A word of caution: I would recommend that people who have normal to oily skin definitely avoid this, or at least try a sample first. It would most likely cause breakouts. It's THAT moisturizing!"
521447,4,"This sunscreen feels great. I HATE applying sunscreen but it's necessary. This is super easy to apply since it sprays out in a finer mist, but I'm not sure I get great coverage. It does not feel greasy on my skin. You do feel a light layer on your skin after it dries, but it's not uncomfortable or sticky like other types. This one is also a great option if you hate the smell of sunscreen. It does have a slight smell, but it's not like regular sunscreen nor as overwhelming."
360447,5,"amazing scrub.  love it!"
561028,5,"I have been using this for several years and recommend it highly for soothing and healing the face after shaving. Can't prove it scientifically but it seems to help the nicks and cuts heal faster. I know for a fact that it eliminates skin irritation, and it is a great wintertime moisturizer - no more chapped skin when it's cold outside.
I had some initial trouble getting over the price but one of these bottles (at two squirts a day, which is more than adequate for the entire face/neck) lasts 4-6 months. Feels like a great bargain now when I need to restock.
It is light, cooling (no sting or scent at all) and non-greasy, and I have found that I can even use my electric razor after applying the Lift Lab (i.e., when I discover I missed a spot with my Schick Quattro razor). The electric razor glides over my skin whether the Lift Lab is wet or dry.  It's that light - not at all like most face lotions. Skin stays moisturized all day after applying this product."
29868,5,"Great toothpaste. Obviously a premium product and probably provides no benefit over regular toothpastes but dammit it just seems nicer. Has a good strength to it and leaves my breath fresh for a while."
140594,4,"Lovely smell and very refreshing but it feels sticky on the skin."
109999,4,"I understand that this is for men, but I was hoping that it would work for me.  I have really bad ingrown hair on my legs. Well it work for that part of my body?"
428084,5,"good"
563453,2,"damaged i want to changes"
570382,3,"Nice and simply packaged down to the liner tip. The wand is just the right length making it easy to use. However, it's a bit narrow so the control is not very stable. Although the tip is very solid and doesnt bend, it is still hard to manage during application as it is very thin.

The black ink is nicely pigmented. It's dark as expected. The lasting power isn't as great as other high end brands but it is great for everyday use, as it doesnt smudge, run or flake off.

I think this is great if you like to play your eyes with wings, etc. Plus points for its simplicity and easy application, but would rather use something else that has a more solid tip applicator.

Overall including the price is 3 stars. If they improved the size for better handling and stability, it would deserve more."
274286,5,"I bought myself this same curling iron 2 years ago and it worked so well, I just bought a 2nd one for my sister.  It heats up quickly and doesn't burn my hair.  Great product."
1581,5,"My oldest SON's first bottle of cologne and he LOVED it! The price was reasonable and well worth it! Amazon has a myriad of perfumes and colognes to choose from. Thanks!"

418684,5,"Arrived promptly, works well, smells wonderful, and last long!"
441418,4,"First, I am in my early 40's, love to be in the sun and have always appeared younger than my age.  I wear very little make-up, generally only makeup on my eyes and maybe a bit of bronzer.
That said, I did not see the immediate removal of the fine lines around my eyes or mouth after use. What I did see an immediate improvement in the appearance of my skin.  Difficult to describe but, my skin seemed brighter-not the faux puffy that you can get with some creams, this is an improvement in the texture and balancing the overall color of my skin.  In the AM skin can look a bit ""ruddy"" with inconsistent coloring.  This helps to balance it. I am really happy with it and makes me less worried about running to the store or taking the kids to practice without taking time to put on make up.  There are many reviews out there celebrating lifting of brows and jowls-the small electrical current should contract the muscles and tighten them, like your face doing ab crunches, makes sense to me-so I am faithfully starting my day with the less than 5 min routine.
The unit should have no feeling, so if you feel ""cold"" or ""pulsing"" it is because you need a bit more gel and turning down the unit.  I could not, however, find a way to use it on my neck without discomfort.  There are several suggestions for less expensive gel's to use once the NuFace gel has run out but for only $12 for a 2oz tube, I plan to stick with theirs.
There are MANY you tube videos that give how-to's and other ways to use the NuFace Trinity, which are helpful and entertaining:)"
444764,5,"As expected, the eyeshadows are very pigmented. The only complain i have is it tends to produce loose powder."
400498,5,"really like this shampoo, need to get the conditioner"

125172,5,"I love this product - it really helps cure dryness especially on the face and keeps it moisturized. I have an allergy to camphor so this caused me to break out over time after a month of using it. I used to use Noxema back in my youth and I had the same breakout reaction. Totally bummed that I cannot use this on my face."
352749,5,"Best self tanner I've ever used. Natural ,believable color. Easy to apply. Will definitely refer it to all my friends! I've bought one for my sister in law ,too."
182523,3,"Received the product and it was shaken"
439865,5,"Doesn't take out color.

Also is pretty good at other ""fungus control"" if you read about such things.
Meaning, ""dandruff shampoo"" in general is a fungicide.

I don't get dandruff, but for an itchy scalp this helps immediately when used symptomatically.
It also helps, strangely, with dry patches of skin on the nose or bridge.  But don't leave it on the sensitive skin more than 30 seconds.
It's a bit too strong to leave it full concentrated."
353988,4,"it made my hair feel really soft and smooth. Will probably buy the conditioner as well. Its my favorite product."
136273,1,"I was excited to try a  ""healthy"" nail polish. I'm not sure if we are getting old polish or a knock off or what but it is awful. Both my sister in law and I ordered and it is streaky and chalky. I seriously can't stand it."
1102,5,"This toothpaste is amazing It is my favorite because I drink a lot of tea and it does a great job removing the stains!"
423796,5,"Great stuff. I'm super pale and it isn't too dark for me. It has the consistency of make-up primer and works well under make-up."
446302,5,"My hair was so damaged! My stylist recommend this product and it is amazing. For bleached and processed hair is the best!"
193562,5,"I have used the Obagi line for almost a year and I can say this truly changed my skin! I had mild break outs at 30 and this totally eliminates any acne or pimples! I have to keep using it now since it makes your skin so clean and tight! Best product lines and I have tried everything on the market! I use the face wash and the pore therapy with my electronic face brush everyday! does dry a little a first but totally normal and then your face adjusts to it and it is wonderful!"
284143,5,"I love Shellac polishes! With a steady hand and proper cure time (read the directions, duh) in the UV light, these polishes make for the best manicures I've ever had - much less done myself without paying a salon!! My nails grow pretty fast, so my Shellac manicures last about two weeks - and the only reason I have to re-do them is because you can see my nail beds, not because it's chipped. If it chips within a week, I know I did something wrong with curing or removing the air-inhibited layer.
In addition, the Wildfire color is AMAZING!!! So sassy and classy at the same time, perfect with a little black dress and for work. I have super pale skin so prior to this color I always thought a bold red was too much for me...no longer! LOVE how this looks.
My cautions are:
Don't get the polish all over your fingers. Clean up any messes BEFORE you cure it - otherwise you'll end up with edges that catch on clothes and towels, your manicure won't last as long or look as nice, and cleaning up after the fact is harder than just having a Q-tip with acetone handy to wipe up any polish that's on your cuticle or the sides of your fingers before you set it in the UV.
Removing your manicure at the end of its days DOES dry out your nails! Let's be real, a resin that requires UV curing is going to require some heavy duty chemicals to remove it - and acetone will weaken and dry your nails. Just be knowledgeable about the products you're using and what they will do to your skin and nails - another duh moment. After using acetone and a cuticle pusher to remove your manicure, WASH YOUR HANDS and use some cuticle oil, then don't paint your nails again right away. Give a couple days for them to recover, keep them filed and use hand lotion. Alternatively, do all of your manicures back-to-back but make sure to wash and moisturize after acetone use.
Basically, just know the product you're using, follow directions, and you too can have salon-perfect manicures without dropping $35+ every few weeks."
372631,5,"Cleaned my sons cradle cap within two weeks! This product is great. Both my boys have fairly sensitive skin and didn't cause a reaction. I also think this product goes along way as you only need one pump for their little heads."

490107,2,"It dried my skin like C R A Z Y"
321974,5,"I have curly hair, but I prefer it straight most of the time. This oil helps protect my hair when styling with heat, and it keeps my hair from frizzing and from being too staticky.

It doesn't have much of a smell, applies easily, and softens the texture of hair well. I definitely recommend this oil."
156777,4,"This lip stain is easy to apply, is not drying or cakey, and a great color.  It's kind of silver/plum and not too bright.  It looks like the colors women wore in the 60's.  Very sexy!!!"
281450,5,"Very smooth and hydrating while long-lasting. Great for right before bed everyday lip treatment! One on my favorite beauty products! Very tasty!"
270687,5,"I naturally have a red nose, like ALL the time.  I don't like wearing full face make up everyday but to match skin tones and hide my red I used to need to.  Now THIS has changed it.  It gives my skin an even tone and a healthy glow if you will without the need to 10 minutes of application and other products.  I do feel like I need to wash it off though after my work day and for sure before a work out because I was noticing some break outs.  Other than that I love this product!!!"
83898,5,"I've been wearing this hair perfume for years and it's one of my favorites. I don't buy the regular perfume because it's really expensive plus I spray perfume in my hair anyway and too be honest I spray this hair perfume all over and it stays on all day.

501095,5,"This salt scrub does work.  The only other scrub I have found thus far which doesn't leave my shower or tub oily and dangerous.  Others have stated it is rather pungent, which is true, however I'm getting accustomed and no longer a factor.  Definitely opens the sinuses!"
289044,3,"I've been battling very dry skin in the winter for several years now, and I purchased this in the extra-large sized lotion after reading all the wonderful reviews. I wish I hadn't spent so much now.

To begin with, the scent is VERY flowery -- so much so that I can't use it at night, as it's too strong and bothers me. I'm also afraid to use it around my daughter, who is allergic to many fragrances, as I suspect it would be a problem for her to smell it on me. So if you don't like flowery scented products, I can't recommend it.

As far as the lotion goes, it seems to work pretty well, but I can't honestly say that it's much better than the other eight or ten types I already have in my house.

I have stopped using this product and returned to the baby oil gel I was using previously. Yes, it is somewhat greasy, but it really works, has very little scent, and is much cheaper.

(On the other hand, I'm in love with Ahava's bamboo and pansy cream wash. I find it to be an amazing product and recommend it highly. You can read my review of it there.)"
21296,4,"It cones out too fast from the shaker just pouring it."
237527,4,"transparent, no smell. Hmm..it's good though."
188465,4,"This is my third blow dryer from Solano.  I am a fan of the product and the results are fantastic.  One downside of the past 2 I have owned is that they last about 2 years.  They do have a warranty and so if you registar your product you should be ok with a repair (this is information I was not aware of until now) that is why I decided to buy a third one.

The 3500 Lite is really very super lite!  However it is very noisy.  The 1800 watts do blow out a lot of air which is good.  So considering it is my third solano, obviously I am a fan."
341014,3,"I really love MoroccanOil products and couldn't wait to try out this one. It smelled divine and moisturized really well. Much to my dismay, a few minutes later, it broke my legs out in itchy, red bumps. It's fine everywhere else though; I use it on my arms. Don't buy this if you have very sensitive skin."
449770,5,"It's not sticky and doesn't leave a gross layer like other suncare products. I love it!"
174041,4,"LOVE love this fragrance, and the container is beautiful!  If Robert Redford had a scent, THIS would be it! I I have it in my entry and it fills the entire home, 2 stories, with a clean, outdoor scent while burning.  Even un-lit, my hallway smells terrific! It's not too strong, very subtle. Would be five stars, only when I burn it, and as the directions say the first burn is important that you let it melt all the way to the edge, I let it burn all day, 8 hours to be exact, and it does not burn entirely edge to edge.... It actually burns about 1/2"" away from the edge.  I blow out the candle and re-light after about 2 hours when the wick gets too long, just to trim it, then immediately re-light.  So, all I can tell you is I'd like it even more if it were to burn entirely.  I'm sure it would last  longer, too.  All in all, you can't beat the wonderful woody, slightly masculine spice it has. It doesn't hit you like a plug in deodorant or heavy scented oil, no one even realizes it's the candle that smells so great!!!!  That's the best part."
484278,5,"Excellent self tanning product. Produces a nice olive toned tan. Highly recommend to get the tanning mitt to blend in."
319532,1,"This really deserves a NO star rating. The bottle is correct, but the content is NOT Crabtree & Evelyn. I've been buying this product for many years, because I love the smell.  After recently moving, I thought it would be easier to buy a couple of bottles online, since I've been unable to find this at any local shops.  This smells NOTHING like Crabtree & Evelyn Avocado. I went against my better instincts and bought this even though the seller was not Amazon, they were only acting as the warehouse.  This product is not eligible for return. So I learned my lesson. Hopefully this review will prevent you from making the same mistake as me."
38437,5,"I use this product all the time.  It arrived on time and nicely packaged.  Thank you!"
169277,5,"I purchased Dodgy Barnett and it is a beautiful sheer holographic polish. I applied two coats and it is not completely opaque, just can just slightly see the nail line underneath. However, I'm perfectly fine with the polish being slightly sheerer because it is complimented well by the delicate holographic shimmers in the polish. If you really wanted an opaque finish you can apply a silver polish underneath and use this as a finishing topcoat.
I had average wear time with this, I have minor/average chipping on my fourth day of wear, and that's without a top coat. Overall if you're a fan of holographic shimmer, I would invest in Dodgy Barnett"
149961,5,"Love this stuff! I am prone to cystic acne. I feel one coming on and I put this on it definitely lessens the severity of it. Be careful...it is very drying."
355642,5,"Purchased this product on a trip to Paris for the first time, and I absolutely loved it! I have rosacea and this foundation is one of the very few that really calms my skin and gives me a great finish. It glides on, is not heavy, and has good coverage. I also really trust the brand, as I have several other products from La Roche-Posay and I am happy with every single one of them. Great line for problem prone skin!"
210216,5,"Like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around. Its a larger amount than I expected. Ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps. They last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them. This one is very pleasant, very nice shave, lathers easily (I have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1-5 its a 2-1/2) and Im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation. I have a tough beard that grows in many directions and I would definitely recommend this soap."
172508,5,"I have been using Cetaphil moisturizing lotion for my face and that was too greasy for me. I recently discovered Mario Badescu products and  so far this works well for me. My skin absorbs it well without the greasy feeling and look. By the end of the end, I can still feel my face hydrated. It's worth the price in my opinion."
499240,5,"I first found out about this particular product at the nail salon I was going to at the time, approximately 4 years ago. My nail tech would put this on my hands after she had finished my gel nails and massage it into my skin, and the aroma was incredible, and my hands felt so soft and looked so good. So, through her, I bought some for myself and my husband and I use it all the time, esp in the winter, when our hands need it more than normal. It is truly a great product!!"
340682,5,"the Girlfriend loves her hair goop  very happy !!!"
239886,3,"Once again another Mizani product lets me down :(

Pros: It is very light. This moisturizer will not weigh your hair down. I do like the smell which is a plus.

Cons: However, it's almost too light. I don't think it gives my hair enough moisture, which can be a bad thing. IDK maybe I should have tried the Butter Rich instead. Its also very expensive, i paid $20 for this. I have never paid $20 for a moisturizer before.  I really wanted to like this product. Normally, I love light moisturizers, but Mizani's Coconut Souffle is so light that half of the time I'm not sure if it is working or not.

Update: i hate this stuff!!!! It dries out my hair."
426711,4,"I am the wife of the person listed (we all use his account in our family). This product is great for damaged, frizzy hair. Doesn't eliminate frizz, but helps. Definitely takes out tangles. I have been using it for years."
32232,2,"This sounded like a deal too good to be true. I should have known better, but I fell for it. The product I received is not the Detangler by Paul Mitchell. There is an underlying odor, not overpowering, but definitely there. My guess is that some actual product was mixed with whatever this stuff is, in an attempt to pass it off as authentic."
244640,5,"This new nail polish is great.  I've had it on for over a week and it still looks great!  The secret I think is in the top-coat.  Don't forget to buy that too.  I can't comment at this time at how easily it removes though.

The color covers wonderfully.  You can't see the whites of your nails through it.  It does have a slight shimmer/sheen to it versus being completely matte.  I don't think the color is quite as pink as it shows on the computer screen, but I know all monitors show color differently.  It's a good, light pink/purple shimmer shade for the summer though.  :)"
240129,5,"I purchased this when out of my hometown, my son needed a haircut...we went someplace new and the hairstylist recommended it for hair and body. She explained that it is a natural antiseptic as well so it works well on acne. I have a little middle-aged adult acne and so every day I have included it in my facial routine. Wash face in shower, get out....typically go over face with OXY or Stridex pad witch leaves my skin very dry. Put this Tea Tree moisturizer on my face (a little goes a long way).  My face still feels slightly dry....I also use Pink Grapefruit Acne oil free lotion from Neutrogena for a little extra moisture without oil.  I am telling you my face has been so clear and soft. Recently, my son took the only bottle we have with him for two weeks vacation; while he was gone my face broke out BAD!  It was the only step in my process that I was missing - I didn't change anything else! He came back, I started using it again and my face is healing fast!  Back to no acne!  I am ordering 2 bottles!  Also my son is a swimmer - this has been wonderful for his hair."
115132,2,"Hated it. I have tried tons of dry shampoos and this is one of the worst. Bad smell, and it made my dark brown hair look like corn flower was poured all over it EVEN AFTER shaking my hair out, and yes I held it far enough away... I still look like I am wearing a yellow dust mask. This may work for elderly women or women with no color to their hair, but if you're a brunette or raven haired girl, stay away!"

83841,5,"Amazing smell!!! I don't wash my hair everyday due to it being dry and it gets a stale smell so I thought I would try this since it got such good reviews. OMG- it smells great. My husband even said he loved the smell. Little pricey but worth it."
546794,3,"A little disappointed with this product. The color oxidizes fairly quick and doesn't apply well."
276141,5,"This is a great sunscreen. It does NOT burn if you use it around your eyes at all. I use it before I put on my tinted moisturizer, BB or CC cream (depending what I'm wearing that day). If you have oily skin, you will love this because it doesn't make you oily in the slightest. If you have combination skin, you may find that you need to add extra moisturizer to your dry areas."
326467,1,"Received a sample foil packet of this product.  It produced amazing results and gave me the hands of a young woman. Not so the actual product. The lotion in this tube is nothing like the sample.  Visually and skin-wise after application, it leaves my hands exactly the same, except for the feeling that I have coated my skin with a drying product that has sucked the moisture from my skin.  I waited too long to send it back.  That window of opportunity closed last month.  Buyer Beware!  Let my experience be a lesson for you - don't waste your money!!"

529182,5,"This is a magical, lightweight and incredibly effective moisturizer. It absorbs quickly and feels like nothing on my face. 2 pumps is plenty for my face and neck, and still is remarkably effective. It really brightens and softens my skin, erasing little lines as it moisturizes. Most of all, it's really incredible at dealing with the crazy dryness that comes on with bitter winter weather."

37445,5,"I'm loving this Baxter of California toner that I received from Amazon Vine. I've been using it for a few weeks now, and the results have been positive. It's very easy to apply, dries fairly quickly so you can put on any moisturizer you want before leaving for the day or going to bed, and leaves the skin looking good. It has a pleasant smell - the mint is a nice addition. The 10 fluid ounces you get is actually going to last quite a while. I'm guessing I won't have to buy a bottle of this until maybe 3 or so months from now. So, it seems expensive, but it's pretty low on a cost-per-use. Overall, I'm very pleased with this toner and will be sticking with it."
131358,1,"The comment is only for the black version of the fiber.

While the fiber itself seems to be okay, the color is a bit off. The black fiber is not black to match my hair, but rather a bluish ash color. After using the fiber, it looks like it just walk through an ashy attic.
Do not recommend the black version of this."

117783,4,"On traditional shaving forums this product is regularly recommended as a quality shaving cream. It took me a year of wet shaving to finally try it, and now I have to wonder what I was thinking? This is the best cream I've used. It lathers better than anything else I've used and makes my shaves much more comfortable. With a tiny amount of cream I can create enough lather for three and a half smooth, comfortable passes.

This cream also creates a really cool, tingly sensation on my face, and sort of numbs any razor irritation that might occur. Now that I've found this, I doubt I'll try anything else in the near future.

Update: Since I first posted this review, I've tried other creams. I've switched between the Proraso and these other creams. It is still a very good product and a good value, but I've found better (Taylor of Old Bond Street) so I reduced the number of stars to 4."

Some of my extended family members have male and female pattern hairloss from their genetics and they swear by this product. They've pretty much everything that you can think of and Revivogen is the only that worked for them because it actually focuses on blocking the hormones that cause the hairloss. It also uses natural ingredients and has been around for like 20 years or something. I bought this for myself to maintain my hair and so far I'm liking it. Will update in a few months. :)"

Good

* Relatively harmless compared to all the creams and lotions

Bad
* Takes time (actually patience) to apply this (about 5 mins daily)
* Might get uncomfortable for some with the high heat generated

I will update this review in about 6-8 weeks.  But right now with the initial usage - it certainly looks like a great buy"

This rosewater spray is great to moisturize your skin when it is dry, especially in the winter months when we tend to overheat our houses. Now, when fall and winter are fighting to determine the next day's weather, it is so nice to be able to spray on this moisturizing spray that dries in just a few minutes and leaves your skin feeling soothed and refreshed. You can use it in the morning, or at night, or both, if your skin needs it.

I have sensitive skin and like the fact that this rosewater is so pure. It is steam distilled and only natural ingredients are added, nothing to impair its purity.  I have been very pleased with this product and think you will be also."

473792,5,"Disclosure: I received this compliments of Michael Todd Beauty in return for an honest review.  Regardless all thoughts are mine and 100% honest.
I was glad to review this item because I've been long time customer of Michael Todd and LOVE their products.  This, like the other products I've used from Michael Todd, didn't disappoint.  It's got a great consistency and it is a gel, but it does in fact lather nicely to my surprise.  I like that the pump dispenses just the right amount for one wash, and it really goes a long way.  I have horrible skin in my 30's and don't really know why because I didn't when I was younger, but this stuff works great on my skin.  Literally the morning after the first use, I noticed a lot of the bumps on my face had decreased in size and even the discoloration which really bothers me.  Immediately after use, my face feels really clean and probably my favorite thing is that my face isn't dried out and irritated, quite the opposite which is different for me.  A lot of cleansers I've used don't leave my face feeling as moisturized.  The only drawback on this is that their is an odd scent and it does linger, however, I'm not that picky so this alone wouldn't keep me from continuing use of it.  My son, a teenager, has been using this as well daily, which says a lot because he's usually pretty quick to give up on a product if he doesn't see results quick.  I'll definitely be purchasing more of this."

I tried this based on the reviews and am thrilled!  I've tried other ""dry touch"" sunscreens but they still made my skin more oily and ""slid"" or ""moved"" moved on my skin; this one did not.  Since it's summer and I am oily I am using this as my primer with no moisturizer underneath, I am sure in the cooler months I will add a moisturizer.  Here is an example, I put this on and the applied my foundation and make-up like usual today, it was 90 degrees by 10am and I spent the morning up through lunch working in a food pantry with no AC....just checked my make-up and it's still there and looking good!  Well done La Roche-Posay, well done!"
532324,5,"LIFE CHANGING. This is the only brand of micellar water I've ever used, so I can't compare to other brands. However, this does exactly what I wanted it to do -- cleans my face & gets the junk out of my pores without leaving any residue or drying out my skin. I live in a city, and even on days I don't wear makeup, I can *see* all the nasty junk that was previously in my pores on the cotton pad after soaking it with this micellar water and rubbing it over my face. Sometimes I wonder if it cleans my face even better than my usual face wash.

Also--my skin is always super soft (and dare I even say...vibrant?!) after using this product. Since I have very sensitive skin (+rosacea) that's easily irritated by normal face washes, this has been life-changing for me. I would highly recommend purchasing this if you have sensitive skin and are looking for a high-quality cleansing solution that doesn't require putting soap or water on your face!!"

207030,4,"[Revised review:] After about four months ownership, I was first afraid of this razor a bit, then I became quite fond of it (infatuation, really), then I put it in the closet. I have a couple other DE razors that, when paired with the right blade, give consistently more comfortable shaves that can still be quite close without the potential irritation and hazard of this slant.

If you have skin that's rather on the tougher side and need a high-capacity razor, this may do the trick. It can shave very close, baby-skin close. Just be sure to use light pressure and shave exclusively with direct strokes (that is, stroke direction parallel to the handle). Oblique strokes will either nullify the slant, or, worse, increase it, which could lead quickly to blood loss.

For shave capacity, this slant razor has plenty. In terms of harshness, however, it is only moderate. For one thing, larger capacity (larger blad-bar gap combined with neutral blade exposure) tends to correlate with increased harshness. Secondly, the slanted blade has a twist as well (which is the nature of slant-bar razors) that makes the blade edge have varied blade angles (different than the constant slant) along its length. (This is all explained in various blog articles of mine.) The varied blade angle makes the edge more face friendly at the end where the blade-bar gap is larger, but more harsh where the gap is smaller -- so the large capacity plus the varying blade angle yields the moderate harshness. So if you have sensitive skin and are determined to use this razor, be sure to use a blade that is coated for smoothness. Pick a blade just sharp enough to suit your beard, but get coated blades to suit sensitive skin.

Five stars for quality, great blade self-centering (when the proper process is used -- see my web site), heft and implementation of the general design. Three stars because *any* slant razor is kind of a specialty, niche product that is often overkill.... probably not for most shavers. Average: four stars.

To read my articles that include my evolution of opinion on this razor (from fear to infatuation to apathy) and much more, check out shavelikegrandad[dot]blogspot[dot]com and be sure to substitute periods (.) for the [dot]s in the URL.  Happy shaving!"

268275,5,"I have very sensitive skin, and some other eye creams leave me with little red bumps under my eyes.  This cream feels spongey to the touch and leaves your under-eyes super moisturized.  A little bit goes a long way, and the tube lasts a long time!!!  As good as any eye cream I've tried, and worth the money.  You won't be disappointed!"
286111,5,"Great lotion!!!"
37893,5,"great results"
302265,5,"This conditioner has been a favorite of mine for over a year.  All ingredients are natural, only a small amount is needed and for half the price I paid in a salon, it's a must have !"
343538,5,"this by far the best soap ive ever used wished i had it highschool.  it will make you smell so clean and fresh a must buy or try.. when the soap starts getting half or is rip able i rip it in 4s and makes it last over a month.  i buy this soap every chance i have extra money would really love to see it in walmart or another retailer"
212823,4,"great product, works good"
150311,3,"Definitely doesn't work as good as I had hoped.... Its worth a try for your skin type. Personally ""neutrogena on the spot"" works way better for me. But find what works good for you!"
133936,5,"I was so pleasantly surprised at just how well this product works. I had previously used Great Hair Days powder and the Toppik fibers blows it out of the water! I have severe thinning of my hair in the front, due to weight loss and am very self conscious about it. This product has restored my confidence! It is easy to learn to use and gives a very nice finished look, I Highly recommend it! I WILL be buying it again. Good Luck all :)"
333078,3,"Lathers up extremely well, but has an odd smell like shoe polish."
507942,1,"Ugh!, this stuff is so thick and icky, like old peanut butter! Stays sticky and gross for HOURS, catches your clothes, your hair, and if you wear it at night it makes you stick to your bedding. Smells awful, like 70's Avon perfume. I didn't notice it doing anything helpful at all. Not recommended!"
269652,5,"My husband wears the regular Eternity, and I love the way it smells on him. He wanted to try something new. I am a big fan of Eternity for him and did not want to stray too far away from that scent for him. I saw this one so I decided to purchase it for him. It is a different scent than the original Eternity but still close enough in the same family that I still like it on him. It is a little lighter than the original and has a fresh, clean scent. I like both for different reasons."
315614,5,"So cool!"
383338,4,"Love the fragrance. Doesn't last long"
507593,4,"none"
223592,5,"i have always been a super solano devotee but this has changed my mind.  the infrared system really dries your hair more quickly."
117094,5,"I love this soap. I only use a little bit of it and it makes my whole skin feels clean. I had issues cleaning my armpit from the deodorant before. I remember washing it and still felt the antiperspirant on my skin. Ever since I've used this soap I only rub  it a couple times and I can already feel my skin is clean. I don't need to use a loofah or a face cloth to get rid of dirt and lotion on my skin. This will do the work alone. I love it!!"
72072,5,"I am not a shower snob, and do not own more than one conditioner or one shampoo. I recently had someone put the shampoo and conditioner version of this product in my hair and was sold on the tingly clean tea tree feeling. So I thought, what the hell, Ill try the soap. At the price it wasn't too bad. It also lasts a little longer than the average soap bar. For someone who is minimalist in the bathroom, this soap made the cut."
563940,5,"SMELLS FANTASTIC, WORKS WELL. MY SKIN FEELS SOFT AND HYDRATED AFTER USE."
138004,5,"This cream worth every penny you spend on! "
92279,5,"I've used this product for years and I love the way it makes my hair feel and look. I've tried similar products from other manufacturers but this is the best. I have very fine, slightly thinning hair so I only use a small drop mixed with a good pomade and my hair looks full, shiny and healthy."
223995,5,"My hair is naturally straight. But I never knew that a hair dryer could make a difference to your hair.

Now I never need to worry about fuzzy hair after using some cheap hair dryers. I can't believe I've been using hair gel for so many years...

This hair dryer is great. Now I don't even think I need my hair strengthener anymore."
94960,5,"Once I discovered this product, I gave all my other hair care products away."
252113,4,"The moment this arrived I ran to my mirror to try it out. I lined it up and clamped it for ten seconds and nothing happened. I tried again, this time I pulsed  it three times for three seconds each time and BAM! nice curl and no pinching. The curler does seem a little fragile, but it really doesn't need that much pressure. Four stars because of the fragility. Good curler with a good design."
455333,2,"worked great while it worked!!!!!! Had it one year and used it an average of 3x per week. Just died on me in the middle of blow drying my hair :(."
568226,5,"Oh my goodness, the smell of this soap is from heaven.  It lasts and lasts on your hands, too.  Delicious."
469872,5,"Just pretty. The only thing that is missing for me is a cream color matte eyeshadow."
45609,5,"This is the best flat iron ever.  It is very easy to use and you don't screw your hair up.  That was a problem with me ... this is foolproof.  You should get a storage bag to go with it.  It makes it easy to put it away.  Thank you!"
24823,5,"Really needed this. Didn't want to spend $$$ on a fancy one. They surprise you with an adhesive on the back so you can mount it on the wall to keep it out of the way."
518248,5,"Effective, gentle, non-greasy cream. This is my 4th purchase."
65842,5,"My Husband has seen difference in skin since using this."
237281,5,"My dermatologist recommended this for my drying skin. Plus I'm getting older and needed something stronger (49 years). I also have rosacea which I'm taking oracea for (the only thing that helps besides laser). The lotion has an SPF too. It's my favorite and gives my skin a better glow. I use it every morning. It's been the best for me."
387058,4,"works great!"
201881,5,"I'm a fan!!!! Lots of healthy glow!!!!"
259458,5,"Since getting this product a couple years ago from my dermatologist I have been using it instead of coverup makeup."
219535,4,"good for travel touchups"
406644,5,"This bottle will last you 6 months it is so concentrated."
201777,5,"Little bit sweet"
305947,5,"Love this stuff"
204865,1,"Product was not in the box! Unacceptable!"
422087,2,"I got this one because it was professional grade and I believe you get what you pay for.  After trying several times and even on the highest setting it wouldn't curl my shoulder length hair. I liked the ease but not the performance."
289859,4,"This razor is solidly built and you can get a good shave from it but it's not going to give you a very close shave.  the comb edges give it and almost idiot proof shave. I like using it when I'm in a hurry and I can just run it over my face as fast as I want with no worries about any cuts."
70642,4,"Still doing a good job."
96656,5,"I have tried dozens of products over a lifetime, searching for the product that would achieve strong hold, but soft - not crunchy or stiff, waxy or flaky. This is it. I get stopped regularly and asked which product I use... and I do not have easy curls.  I am positivey evangelical about MOP C-Curl. Worth the high price tag."
554666,4,"well it's a free sample"
453862,5,"Hands down the best smelling pomade i have ever tried.  Nice shine, and great hold as expected.  I will continue to buy Reuzel red, hopefully from the same seller. Thanks!"
152744,5,"Although I did not purchase this shampoo from Amazon I still wanted to get on here and give it a rating as it is a great product and saved me from scratching the scalp off my skull. I have long thick hair and exercise regularly, this always left me in a bad predicament since you are left with a sweaty head and by all means you don't want to deal with washing your hair every time you work out if your like me.

Generally I wash my hair twice to three times a week, have color treated hair, and an extremely itchy scalp. So itchy that one night I found my boyfriend holding my hand down in my sleep because he was awoken by me scrapping away at my scalp!

Ever since I started using this shampoo the itchiness went away from first use, this was a miracle! My hair also stays cleaner and looks better even post work out and I no longer feel gross skipping washing my hair immediately after.

Yes its pricey, but it smells great, lathers on great & certainly changed my life for the better.

So thank you Malin + Goetz for saving my hair, my scalp and my nail polish :)"
9753,5,"I have used this product for years and will continue to buy it. Reduces the signs of aging love it"
486037,5,"This red is gorgeous and perfect for Christmas. It's shiny and has a beautiful metallic sheen (not glittery) but magically Christmas looking."
358722,5,"Best Mascara out there"
571322,1,"Wear gloves!!!! I bought this because it got such good reviews in the fashion magazines.
The color is like a dark brown-green (sounds weird but it evens out the orange)
I sprayed it on this morning and got too close to my skin so I ended up having these
dark areas, so I used my hands to quickly rub the spray in to avoid the patches and the
self tanner does not wash off your hands....AT ALL.
My palms look like I was playing in dirt, but at least dirt I could scrub off.

If you use this product, use a mitt or make sure the can is far away from your skin."
539703,2,"It flakes like crazy, gets into your eyes."
90295,5,"Nice weight and design. I bought it for my husband and he really likes the close shave he gets with it (and so do I)!"
536515,5,"Wonderful quality tea tree oil. I wish I could give it 10 stars. The price is very good for such good quality oil. I use it for everything and will soon shop more of it, from the same providers. It arrived quickly and without hassle. Very recommended."
507107,5,"If you follow the directions and are consistent, it works well for toenail fungus. You have to catch it early, however, and take action as soon as you detect fungus."
88871,5,"I'm sold on this Chi hair spray.  It's strong enough to hold my short, curly hairstyle, but light enough to be able to run your fingers through your hair (depending on how much you use).  Plus, it has a great fragrance which is not obtrusive,"
442466,5,"Great buy!! I LOVED it!!"
521040,5,"While I've never used the fibers, I love this shampoo and the conditioner (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TOPPIK-Hair-Building-Conditioner-8-5-fl-oz/dp/B000MMZJJI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TOPPIK Hair Building Conditioner, 8.5 fl. oz.</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TOPPIK-Hair-Building-Conditioner-8-5-fl-oz/dp/B000MMZJJI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TOPPIK Hair Building Conditioner, 8.5 fl. oz.</a>). Some people have said it's a bit expensive but for the me, both are worth every penny."
29176,4,"The neon color is very true to the picture. Definitely a irreplaceable shade to everyone's summer collections."
508515,4,"Pros:  Leaves my skin feeling SO incredible.
  And smelling wonderful.
  Very soothing cream, super rich.
Cons:  Super rich and creamy: so much so that it is a little difficult to rinse out of my razor (I use a DE safety razor).
  Also takes a fair amount of time to get a good lather going, but not too bad.
  Cost: this stuff is pricey per ounce
I received it originally as a gift, and its good enough that I have bought several more over the years for use when I want super smooth, soft, great smelling skin with a close shave."
396550,5,"Fabulous love it"
366019,5,"Works perfect with my Elchim Blow dryer! It has made it easier to work with people that have curly hair."
483647,5,"Love the color"
243962,3,"The color was not quite what I expected but I love the polish."
461728,4,"Smells great."
316400,5,"I was really impressed with this palette! I own all 3 of the Urban Decay naked palettes, but this nude palette has a little bit from all three. The colors are really pigmented. A little goes a long way! Also there isn't a lot of fallout which is a big pro compared to the higher priced Naked palette. I didn't have to clean up at all in the under eye area when using it. This was my first theBalm purchase and I will definitely be purchasing more of their products in the future."
312723,5,"AMAZING DIFFUSER ! Love it ! .. It fits my Conair 1875 Blow dryer ! It gives body without frizz and defines my curl . It actually gives it a dryer looking curl without making it hard and crunchy (using conditioner, or gel etc.) it doesnt fit my conair 1875 quiet tone blow dryer though .. It mostly fits blow dryers with the smaller opening"
320111,5,"I've found this to be the best micellar water. Perfect for sensitive skin and yet powerful at removing makeup, even waterproof mascara."
252838,1,"I like the smell but once sprayed it would last only few minutes. Therefore it is useless and not worth the money spent."
320480,5,"I have very sensitive skin  and I have no problem with this product. Will buy it again in the future."
40141,5,"I used EA green tea years ago and actually thought that it wasn't being produced anymore.  My order was delivered promptly and I have no complaints.  I don't think that there is room for improvement because from order to delivery the process was very effecient."
323717,5,"I use this once a week. I put it in my towel dried hair and keep it in while I clean the house. About 2 hours or so. Works wonders."
438232,5,"does not damage hair and straightens easy."
347335,5,"LOVE IT!!!!!"
34808,5,"When I was a child growing up in Europe, this product was a mainstay of any household. Now that I am an adult, I am so happy tone able to purchase it in the US. Simply put, this is the best eye makeup remover. It is soothing and never stings my eyes and I wear contact lenses."
463751,5,"Great color turnout, even on my highly pigmented lips, good wear time, smells good - seem to always get compliments about it when wearing!"
212767,2,"Wasnt as expected..."
320429,5,"Updated...I've been using this every night for five months and love it! It cleans away oil and make-up with ease. It feels slightly tingly and fresh, and has improved my complexion.  I use it for cleaning away all make-up, even mascara. Just squirt the product onto a cotton round, and voila! (It usually takes two to three rounds to remove all traces of mascara.)
Highly recommend!!!"
204651,3,"Smells clean, but very strong. Very soapy scent but not a light scent. Lasts 4 hrs or so on me. You only need a light spray."
214242,5,"I was first introduced to this product on a Caribbean Cruise.  I love that it doesn't require water to wash it off.  Just cotton pads followed up by the apricot toner.  It is a great product."
295551,5,"This cologne is a great present if you're considering it for a gentleman or if you're a guy on the fence thinking about buying it. Personally I get tons of compliments from ladies and other guys too. It is not a strong smelling cologne like a Versace, but it lasts and makes a good impression from those who you're in contact with!"
278563,5,"I have been a long time user of StriVectin and have loved what it does for my skin. I have been using this new formula for a few weeks now and just love how it makes my face feels. I am a fanatic about taking care of the skin on my face and neck and could not do without StriVectin. I would recommend it to anyone."
55119,5,"Great classic scent!"
154491,1,"I applied this after I washed my hair with bumble bee and bumble bee thickening shampoo and conditioner. After I blow dried with a round brush. There really was no difference. I couldn't even feel any product in my hair. If I could return this I would."
37132,5,"Loved worked the best for eczema"
329005,5,"Gives volume throughout the day like no ther product. Use sparingly at the roots, can make hair a little sticky if over used."
563249,3,"GREAT PRODUCT BUT HIGHLY OVER PRICED !

BETTER PRICE SEE LINK BELOW !
[...]"
454475,1,"The promises made in the informercials is not what I received when using this product.  This product did not leave my hair frizz free.  It left it hard to manage and heavy.  Also, it left a film on my hair that you could feel on your hand after touching my hair.  I would not recommend this product.  I am very disappointed I spent the money I did."
230729,5,"Great stuff.  Goes on smoothly and does not smudge or smear all day long."
499416,5,"Excelente"
459759,5,"Great product"
136599,5,"Plumps up fine lines, great to use at night and in the morning before concealer. Helps prevent crepey look."
290456,4,"its great for a tinted sunscreen however DO NOT let 1 drip of this stuff get on your clothing or anything you cherish it WILL NOT come out"
441799,3,"I've been using this pretty faithfully every day for a month. It's a nice moisturizer--it absorbs well, doesn't smell overwhelming, a nice light texture. Whether or not it's making me look any younger is another matter. My skin is nicely hydrated, but quite frankly I don't see any difference as to how young or old I look (for the record, I'm 48). Maybe it's a touch smoother. It's not like anyone has run up to me and said I look younger, or well rested, or anything, which I was secretly hoping for. But since I have it, I will continue to use it--it's a nice moisturizer."
235031,5,"After 38 years of oily skin, during my pregnancy my face started to get pretty dry. Let me tell you, I would never again complain about my oily skin. I tried everything and every product I could to try to get my skin back. Nothing worked until this cream. I use it everyday and after about a week of light peeling my face is now back to its oily self! Will definitely keep using this."
512858,5,"This product is absolutely incredible in hiding my roots and I don't know what I ever did without it. It blends perfectly with my hair colour and applying it is incredibly easy. Any of the reviews complaining about difficulty applying should not be taken seriously. If you can apply lipstick, you can apply this. It stays in place until shampooing, does not run even with heavy rain or intense workouts. Please bring this product back!!!"
451816,5,"Noticeable difference in brassiness after the 1st use today! My actualy color looked a lot fresher as well, as though I recently got it done. I love this brand!! (Btw, I have colored and highlighted natural, kinky/curly hair.)"
490878,5,"This body balm is amazing! Turned my pale uneven veiny legs tan and silky smooth.
Its the consistency of a lotion and absorbs quickly. The bottle is slightly smaller than what I was imagining but I think itll be good for at least 20 applications on legs. I ordered the color latte which is perfect for me when Im not tan. I ordered the mocha darker color for when Im tan. Will update photos of color comparison. Current photo is latte."
14630,5,"i don't know what it is about this product, but it feels great when you put
it on your face....not a miracle cream, but very nice."
418874,5,"Go big! Big ass hog. Reuzel is the best. Goes in nice, pretty good shine, strong hold and it's water based so it washes right out."
339655,1,"Terrible soap!  Does NOT lather whatsoever with a brush.  Enough said Don't bother.
On the other hand, it does smell excellent so it is a nice shower soap."
442887,5,"Favorite of all the Crabtree and Evelyn products"
124306,5,"IT REALLY WORKS, I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR 2 YEARS AND MY SKIN HAS IMPROVED TREMENDOUSLY.  CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT IT"
274244,5,"My stylist used the flat iron on my hair. I loved the results. So I decided to make the investment. I will be purchasing the other tools associated with this product. I have gotten so many more compliments on my hair since I started using."
226427,5,"I love this conditioner, helps restore the moisture in my damaged hair without weighing it down. I use it everyday."
499496,2,"Didn't really do much or make a difference. Used it as instructed and religiously but no difference noted."
45200,5,"Excellent &iacute;tem"
524117,5,"Love these, they do not pull hair out & more comfortable than other tie backs"
371090,5,"I normally wear Chanel but this stuff is great and I don't get oily! Not as much coverage as a foundation but with a little powder I have a flawless complextion with sunscreen!"
380020,5,"Hairdresser introduced this product to me & no I can't live without."
420379,1,"Split on me after a a few uses not even a month after buying."
423369,5,"Wife loves it. Would recommend product and seller"
406403,3,"My sister has been using this for a while now and hair still grows back around her chin. I've only used mine 1 time in a smaller than a dime size spot and it made no difference. A bit time consuming as well! Wouldn't spend the money again. We are fair skinned with dark hair."
380164,5,"I'm not use to hair products actually working, that's why when I used this product I was shocked at how amazing it made my hair look and feel! I sprayed this in my hair after I shampooed and conditioned (using the pureology hydrate shampoo and conditioner, which is also amazing) and then blew my hair dry. It left my hair soft, silky, and shiny. I could go on and on about this stuff but I'll just get to the point.... This product is amazing!!! I highly recommend buying this product and $22 really isn't a bad price for how well this stuff works."
536461,4,"I am a London Town (Lakur) finatic...love all their nail products with the exception maybe this one.  Used the filler and worked well until taking off polish.  Since then my nails have been peeling. I can't say it's because of the filler but it's the only thing I added to my manicure.  Discovered London Town at a spa a year ago.  Have loved it ever since."
570393,3,"I could not figure out how to use the dropper and the instructions said nothing about it. I don't see the point as it's messier than pouring foundation into your hand. In fact, the dropper spilled a drop on my outfit and stained it to the point it was worrisome whether it'd come out. It did. The reason it took work to get it out is because this has zinc oxide (for the sun protection). So you may want to be sure you're over the sink when applying it and not wearing your best clothes.

The color worked well for my pale skin and it made my face look even as best as it can. No product can make it look completely even. The scent was practically non-existent, which should please a lot of folks.

If you're using this for SPF protection, you'll need to reapply every two hours. Most people I know don't reapply foundation that often. So the SPF benefit isn't a great one as it'll mess up your blush. Better to use a clear lotion for SPF than foundation that is supposed to be the make up base. The button on top of the dropper isn't easy to press. Bliss needs to redesign the bottle to make it easier to apply without worrying about messes. I wouldn't count on this for sun protection unless I know I won't be gone more than two hours."
370398,5,"AMAZING! Manicure finally lasted MORE than 7 days!!!  Used along with Negligee and Studio White. Best manicure colors for French."
6754,5,"Perfect.. just like the salon"
168867,5,"I have been using this product for years--it's the best."
145318,2,"Fast shipping, but for some reason I received a different product, 1"" 1/4 instead a 1""..."
138522,5,"worked great, exactly what my wife wanted"
131954,5,"Awesome product.. Can be a bit messy during the application process but in my opinion worth it.. Thanks"
414049,5,"Great product"
250850,4,"Really like this eyelash curler. It's not metal so it seems gentler then those torture device looking metal curlers that you end up getting parts of your eye clamped into. And its more compact so it's perfect to tuck into your purse without it taking up a whole bunch of space. I'm down."
567911,4,"I recently received one as a gift and liked it so much I purchased 4 more.  They arrived on time.  I use it all the time.

I did not care at all for the ugly, large, sticky white label (assume supplier used for tracking product) that was on the side of all 4 units.  Very difficult to remove and makes the product look cheap.

I plan on buying more once these run out.

115867,1,"This stuff stinks and is too thick to work effectively in hair."
273192,3,"Love it!"
328338,3,"too peicey"
172843,2,"This product may work for some, but it didn't work for me.  Too thick and my skin just wouldn't really absorb it.  I couldn't stick with using it long enough to see any results."

265155,5,"Wonderful color, good coverage. Roll tide!"
255133,5,"Never smudges on me. Love this liner. I use this religously. Haven't even looked for a new liner since I bought this one over a year ago."
251013,3,"I was pleased with the performance of this curler & pleased with the prospect of being able to get new pads for the curler, pleased at the thought that ""this will be the last eyelash curler you will ever buy,"" however, it broke at the point where the top bar is inserted into the side."
429292,2,"Well, it is suppoused to bring benefits to the skin.....but only if it gets into the skin. This product is not prepared to get in. It's thick and stays on and then just dryes in white flakes on the skin even if you do your best to rub it in. Nevertheless it has nice scent and very pleasant to the skin."
521597,2,"my daughter has one but a different brand. She decided to buy it because she saw it on a commecial. She says that the other curler makes it more curls and last longer"
272021,5,"This is one of the best products on the market for your hair. As far as a sea spray this is the one,their is no other to compair to it. They have better shampoo and conditioner by other companies instead of Paul Mitchell but no other sea spray. I have to hide mine because everyone who comes over wants to use it."
225088,5,"By far the best product to add shine and condition.  I am 69 and dye and highlight my hair"
180695,5,"use this product every day."
393925,1,"The Klorane shampoo was used with the Leave in Spray but did not offer any benefits to my hair. My hair has actually gotten much more frizzy and dry that I have to supplement with Argan oil. Will not be purchasing again."
568918,5,"I got this for my lovely wife and she wrote the review as follows, ""This lip mousse is a rich dark, berry shade - I would categorize it as a ""cool"" plum color.  I goes on nicely - doesn't feel quite as ""drying"" as some other lip stains I've used in the past.  **NOTE: If you put a gloss on top of this lip mousse, it will come off (on clothing, silverware, glassware, etc.)  Its a nice texture and I appreciate that the color is a nice, brighter (but not screaming) shade.  The sponge tip makes it easy to apply - even to go slightly outside the lipline, if you're trying to make your lips a little fuller.  It comes in a square ""tube"" and the top is a screw-on/off.  Even after a few hours, my lips don't feel dry and cake-y.""  I hope this helps someone decide."
139118,4,"TanTowel Plus is a very nice product.  I have an olive complexion and so it took 3 - 4 applications before I got the tan level I was looking for.  I recommend using '""On the Glow"" Moisturizer after the TanTowel Plus is dry.  Without the moisturizer, I found my face felt and looked too dry.  I also recommend applying this tanning product on a clean, dry face, neck and chest, BEFORE your regular moisturizer.  When thoroughly dry, use the ""On the Glow"".  Also, wash the palm side of your hands, directly after application or your hands will become very dark. Without further applications, my face remained tan for 3 days.  I like this product and would continue to use it."
47136,1,"This is the second baby bliss for me. Will never buy again. First one did not last long so 6 months ago did a repeat purchase. After a few months heat startied pouring out the handle when I was using it which made it too hot to hold. Today,went to blow dry my hair and it essentially blew up in my hand. Made a popping noise and saw sparks then smoke. Scary!  Even tripped the breaker in my house. Thank goodness it did not set anything else on fire. Dissatisfied customer."
454421,4,"Satisfied"
171621,1,"The white balls at the tips of bristles started falling off very shortly after using.  Huge disappointment for a Paul Mitchel product."
228694,1,"I have a lot of experience with self tanner and I do like the regular self tanner from Xen Tan, but this gradual version is really streaky.  I typically apply self tanner with gloves to avoid staining on my hands. I tried with gloves and without gloves and both times it was really, really streaky.  Thankfully since the color is more subtle it wasn't as embarrassing as a streaky regular self tanner. I don't recommend this one to anyone."
384700,3,"Too much shine"
23586,4,"Product does what is says it will do and covers sparse areas.  It looks pretty natural and stays in place all day.  The only criticism is that it can be a little messy to apply, but with continued use, it becomes easier as you learn the dynamic of the product.  I would recommend it to anyone with thinning hair as a quick fix."
184347,5,"I used to use dove, but left my face all dry.  I've since been trying to go more organic and after reading A.S. Kind Diet, she recommended this brand.  I lOVE it!  My face is soft and everyone compliments on my skin now :)"
425267,5,"Good!!!"

446072,2,"My beautician used this on my hair after I had a full color. I fell in love with it. When I found it on Amazon.. I was thrilled and ordered it. However, I'm not too thrilled with it. The consistency is watery on this one.. whereas the one my beautician had was thick. Just to compare... I ordered one from the actual Olaplex website.. the price difference was only a couple dollars more and the product was thick and slightly different in color... it's the same as what my beautician used. I don't know if the one from Amazon was old or what... but it's definitely different from the other one. Even the way it works is different. It was worth the try... but I won't order it again from here :("
155829,1,"EDIT after opening: I normally love this product but I ordered this one on sale and I had bought a refill in May when it was on sale. I wear warm satin and the package says warm satin but yesterday when I opened it up to use I thought it looked too yellow and when looking that the bottom of the refill it says it's actually warm sienna. Unfortunately the return policy is 30 days so returning it not an option. I absolutely LOVE this product but it is expensive and I'm very disappointed since there is no way I can wear this. Lesson learned....open it up and double check that it is the right color."
141357,5,"Love my Mario Badescu Facial Spray! This is my second bottle and I do not want to ever be with out it! My skin looks so much brighter! I use it after I wash my face and also as a setting spray for my BM makeup! Can't say enough about this product!"

56508,2,"This was sencond bottle and first one was good and last longer but not the second bottle, probably its been seating on the shelf for years,.."
276898,5,"I love this scrub. It consists of very fine exfoliating particles( almost dust like fine), so when you use it, you are getting rid of the dead skin cells but, at the same time, you are nor irritating your skin which a lot of the scrubs tend to do. I like that it is a mechanical peel, because with chemical peels sometime I feel like it's not doing much. This peel is excellent you feel the exfoliation, but a very very gentle one. I would recommend using this product once a week, to get rid of the dead skin cells."
181426,5,"This is the best one out there! I have a really hard to manage hair but this one makes it so easy and it really gets hot so be careful.

UPDATE:
It's already AUG 2015, 3yrs since I bought this and it's still going strong. It works like the day I received it. REALLY GREAT QUALITY!"

91480,2,"This is personal contention and I'm sure there many on here who will disagree but to me, having a shave shouldn't be like going to the beauty parlor or salon.  It should be a quick and timeless effort that takes less than five minutes.  I've used the badger brush and does it get the job done and give a good lather, perhaps the best you can get?  Yes.  But can I get close to the same effectiveness using just my finger tips and massaging the shaving cream directly into my skin? I believe so.  As someone who's a fan of all in one solutions and just making things simpler in this world, this is another example of excess and unnecessary pampering IMO.  But what bothers me most about this unit is being told by sales clerks that this is a required tool because it exfoliates and does these wonderful things for the skin.  I don't believe that to be the case.  I think the badger brush is a bit of gimmick for males who want to pamper themselves since facial shaving is something of uniquely testosterone ritual.  And it was invented by the French.

Roughly 20 years shaving experiencing with few nicks, cuts doing it the old fashion way (hands, water, shaving cream)."
191092,5,"Great!"
368948,5,"I love this stuff. only use few times wk. spray a few times on hands n run it thru hair. so soft and then blow dry. dries straight.

got a bottle from marshalls,much cheaper"
478716,5,"hands down, best mascara. I do have to use a lash separator to prevent clumping."
37673,5,"This was recommended by my dermatologist.  It works great for me, and is very gentle.  It reduces my dark circles and fine lines better than any other eye cream I have used, and I've tried a lot.  For the reviews talking about red eyes, I have to assume they got product IN their eyes.  It does state right on the package not to allow the product to get into the eye.  Which makes sense, if it's strong enough to help around the eye, you probably don't want it in your eye!  For the reviews talking about allergic reactions, anyone can suffer an allergic reaction to just about anything, but I am still surprised by the negative reviews.  I have extremely sensitive skin, so much so that I have only found one suntan lotion I can use on my face - only one!  But this product causes me no problems at all.  However, that one suntan lotion I can use did cause a severe allergic reaction for a friend, which completely shocked me as I found it so gentle, but proves the point.  Anyone can have an allergic reaction to an ingredient, it does not make the product a bad product, unless a large percentage of users have the same reaction."
318777,5,"Hard to say what my favorite component on this kit is. Love the leather case it comes in and the overall quality of the tools. The case is top of the line and made of Neat's brown leather with a zip fastener closure, even on the zipper, the craftsmanship is impeccable. The quality of the tools is above average, the scissors for instance, it's like butter when you cut with them, so they work great as well as look great. The details, little details are top of the line, near the best you can get. Besides the leather case you also get the 5 grooming tools-

The tweezers that are painted, satin finished and stainless steel.
The nose and ear trimmers, satin finish and made of stainless steel.
The nail clippers which are made differently than your usual clippers, they're collapsible, thin, lightweight and sharp.
A twin instrument, pusher/cleaner that's satin finished and stainless steel.
A sapphire nail file, satin finish, stainless steel.

You get precision and quality craftsmanship with this kit. Company is based in Germany. For this kind of money It is near top of the line, something that will bring a smile to your face or you'll be proud to carry if you do invest in it, also you'll be satisfied with the results."
356206,3,"Pretty colors but nothing special."
209024,4,"It is soft, gentle on skin and smells good. The only complaint I have is that it bleaches my towels."
315796,5,"Item as describe . I receive it on time and i love it
Thanks"
31764,2,"This was recommended to me by my stylist and, although the spray works great on my hair, the plunger consistently gets clogged so it either depresses without sending out spray or it doesn't depress at all."
167193,5,"I cannot believe how well Toppik works!  I think that some of the negative reviews might have been from people who were actually bald.  This may not work if you are mostly bald---not really sure since that wasn't my problem; however, if your hair is thin, and you have trouble styling your hair to avoid a bald spot, you will be amazed at how Toppik hides the scalp, making it look like you have much thicker hair.  I feel so confident now when I style my hair.  It lasts all day; in fact, I got caught in the rain the first day I tried it, but it stayed in.  Look at this product as make up for your hair, something you use every day.  It's not a miracle substance that will re-grow hair, but when you use it, you'll feel that you look good.  This product does what it says it'll do.  You may be able to find it locally if you have a beauty supply store near you.  I tried the trial size and was so happy with it that I bought a large size. I found that no other accessories were necessary.  You just sprinkle it on the thin section, rub it in, and the scalp disappears!  Spray lightly with any hair spray you have, (no need to buy the special spray) and you are good to go all day long."
24793,5,"The texture and the sheerness of this color of Stila Lip Glaze appeals to me.  It is not long lasting like a lipstick and needs to be applied more often, but since I am using it to moisturize and only lightly color my lips, it is ideal for my purposes.  It gives just a hint of color that is much more pleasing to me than other brands of lip moisturizers I have used."
472760,5,"This cream goes on light and non-greasy, but has a big effect. I have aging skin and this cream gave me soft skin with a younger texture. I loved it."
20722,5,"I have tried several face scrubs and this one is my clear favorite. This product contains the most microfine particles compared to others I have tried. I actually use it every morning before shaving and I get the closest shave ever. My complexion is much more even since using this scrub and the age spots (and fine wrinkles!) have disappeared. I also like the smell which is not overpowering. Two other scrubs I tried have all natural ingredients, but do not contain as many particles and one smells like mint which takes some getting used to or the other has a smell that is so overpowering I have to hold my breath to use it. This scrub is more pricey than those, but a classic case of you will get what you pay for."
260700,2,"I had to return. It was too heavy."
250298,5,"I love this product. My skin feels so clean after using it! I switched to Guinot 3 years ago and have never gone back!"
443071,5,"Love love this scent!!! I don't understand why Crabtree and Evelyn aren't caring it any more. I get tons of compliments on the scent!!! Thank goodness it's available through Amazon!!!"
194738,5,"Arrived quickly, really beautiful pinkish melon color. Two coats was plenty of coverage, and my first manicure with this color lasted nearly a week before it started to dull/chip (and even then, it was seemingly only because I was out gardening with my hands). This is the first time I've spent more than few dollars on nail polish but I'm impressed with this brand."
522730,5,"Ever since I first enjoyed a lemon verbena shower gel provided in my hotel room near Paris' DeGaulle airport ten years ago, I've searched for a lemon verbena shower gel for the home.  L'Occitane's shower gel fits that bill.  Although it's a bit pricey - $36 for this eco-refill - if you have the funds, I highly recommend it."
425952,5,"I was so very excited to receive this makeup holder for the em Michelle Phan makeup. The holder is very sturdy and it comes with a small tool that will allow you to put in the holder which color from the makeup pallette that you want to take with you. It looks nice and I would definitely recommend this holder to my makeup artist friends."
91551,5,"I am a makeup and hair care junkie.. I buy tons but i never fall in love to buy it twice.
I have bought this spray twice now!
great hold. gives you great volume. lightweight. doesn't make your hair crispy like others."

348007,3,"This curling iron is not good for those with curly hair as it pulls...."
267782,4,"I wish you could just get the ones for the face and not have to purchase the large body ones that I don't use."
551683,5,"I adore the applicator. I love the shape, weight and size of the container, This product has me hook, line and sinker. Brilliant. And to seal the deal the makeup itself absorbs quickly and smoothly leaving skin looking flawless. I can't see how this combination can be beat."
92595,5,"Works very well. Was the best price I could find looking in various drug stores and in the salon. I am very happy with this"
216728,5,"One of the better products out there"
532945,5,"Smells fantastic"
204236,4,"After about two weeks: I wasn't expecting dramatic results. The product works well. Really helped the appearance of my of under eye area and crows feet. My eyes appear less puffy in the morning and fine lines are less noticeable. The dark color under the eye is still there but the appearance is lighter than before I started using it. Makeup goes on smoother. It's not greasy. It doesn't  smell funny. It doesn't  irritate my skin or eyes at all. The bottle is larger than I was expecting and a little bit goes a long way. I used an amazon gift card to purchase it, so I only paid a few dollars plus shipping, but I'll most likely go ahead and reorder and pay full price when I run out. I like it better than any eye moisturizer I've used before."
412344,5,"I love everything about this product. The texture, the smell, the collor.."
140200,5,"The product arrived on time. I love the texture and can't wait to see its effect."
225784,4,"okay"
240454,5,"I noticed that I was losing more hair than normal when I washed it.  I started using Bosley for color-treated hair at my stylist's suggestion.  After the first use, the hair loss had stopped.  Also, I have seen a lot of baby-fine growth, which my stylist said would get stronger.  And a lot of it has.  I used Bosley which was not for color-treated hair a couple of times, as the wrong product had been given to me and I thought it wouldn't matter.  Found out it does matter, as I started losing more hair than normal when washing, again.  So, if you have color-treated hair, be sure to use the product  that is specifically for it as it does make a difference."
243293,5,"I LOVE this color! I am  fan of Creative Nail, and this color is very nice."
97244,5,"Love the scent"
521920,5,"After 4 months of using this in conjunction with their shampoo and scalp treatment *every other day*, I can confirm lots of new hair growth where a bald spot used to be! In fact, I am seeing a lot of new hair growth all over my scalp and that's very nice to see. There are of course no guarantees it will work for you. The person who cuts my hair (who is also the one who recommended this stuff) and my wife both confirm it IS working. If you're going to try it, be patient and use exactly as directed. If you're lucky, it just might work for you too but give it time - it's not instant hair."
46198,5,"This is a Excellent Dryer!!!"
260867,4,"Last one lasted me five years!  Well worth it"
43040,5,"I love this cleanser, a definite must have in every shower.  My skins feels and looks great."
344081,5,"Great price!!! Excellent product"
293758,4,"I purchased this item as a gift for my wife as she had an old set which she wanted to replace. Her only comment was that she would liked it better if it had more medium rollers and fewer smaller rollers."
281522,4,"I bought the Nuxe Reve de Miel lip balm because I've seen a bunch of beauty bloggers raving about it and since I'm a lip balm junkie, I had to check it out for myself!

It is super thick and rich, so much so that I actually don't really like to wear it during the day unless my lips are feeling particularly dry or I'm in a very cold dry climate. I bet this would be awesome to wear while skiing! My favorite thing to do is just put it on at night and when you wake up it will still be there!! How insane is that? For the guys, this lip balm is also very matte so you won't look like you have lip gloss on. Yes, it's a bit pricey, but a little goes a very long way so I'm sure this little jar will last forever and you will get your moneys worth."
557260,4,"Ok but too much money for the amount of product."
106881,2,"I have used this product for a long time, but the one I bought in this order has a strange smell (not the yummy mango smell I was used to) is separating already (after 1 month) and seems like a totally different product. Not sure if it is this specific tube or an issue with the manufacturer or with the company that fulfilled the order, but I'm pretty unhappy with it. I have used coola products for a couple of years and generally like their products."
444190,1,"The spray cap was shattered and unusable when it arrived."
549887,5,"Spent my entire adult life as a 34 or 36A and in just a few weeks I bought all new bras, up one size to 36B.  After the initial period of frequent use you only have to use this a time or two every few months.  I love it.  It has been about two or three years for me and I still use and only on my second bottle."
114725,5,"Gave my hair a great boost! Definitely recommend."
261671,5,"Love this"
538966,4,"Not heavy, but you still have to watch that you don't spray too much or you'll end up greasy. I use it as a light leave it conditioner on days that I don't need a lot of styling or de-frizzing power."
82884,5,"Great stuff. Makes my hair look great. Doesn't smell bad either."
523120,4,"buena colonia"
409983,2,"does not smear correctly"
516498,2,"As a hairstylist, this dryer was too heavy for the size and doesn't seem very balanced. The weight seems to be at the back so my wrist was doing overtime.  Blows strong and gets hot enough, but I just wasn't thrilled with it. The Volare V2 is more expensive, but lighter and much more balanced."
4381,5,"good color just a bit to light"
303070,1,"I would have given this a -10 if I could. A lovely splash of vanilla would have been great. This product is very very strong and it almost smells like a medicinal vanilla. I barely sprayed and even though I paid $32.00 for it, it's going in the trash."
99467,5,"Great prduct"
162457,3,"I can't really give this product a yay or nay.  I have only used it once so far but I will make an effort to try it again. The one time I have used it, I found it to be very effective in making the skin soft but I did find it difficult to remove and it did stain my sink for a while."
143167,5,"I'm kbsessed with this product. Everyone needs it!!!"
5320,5,"Great color. Arrived quickly."
181520,5,"I was seeking a large curling iron so I could create soft, loose curls.  I have the 1/2"" Hot Tools Professional iron and after almost 10 years...it still works great.  I was biased while shopping for a new iron and wanted to stick to with the Hot Tools products.  This 1-1/2"" iron works great and is very easy to use.  The iron gets super hot fast, which is very helpful when you are short on time.  Yes, it's a curling iron that can burn your hair...so people, you need to make sure you use a heat protection treatment before curling."
7445,5,"I've been using this product since my grandmother introduced me to it about 10 years ago.  I used to wear acrylic nails and therefore my natural ones were very weak and damaged.  This is AMAZING!  I constantly get compliments on how beautiful my nails are.  In the first week you notice a difference in the overall health of your nails, and in 2-3 weeks you have long, beautiful nails.  Now instead of breaking or peeling, I have to cut my nails down becuase they get too long!  Definitely worth the money, once you try it you will be hooked!"
128594,5,"I have been using Azzaro for about ten years as I think this is the best cologne for me.  It stays on for the entire day and it is always subtle and in the background."
178858,5,"I love this product it gives my hair body & lift without feeling sticky or weighed down!
If you haven't tried it I would truly recommend that you do."
344926,4,"Really like the color and the way it feels, wish it latest longer, but have always had a problem with this."
49830,5,"Seriously love this concealer. For me, it matches my skin tone so perfectly I have trouble seeing it! Goes on breath smooth and doesn't end up dry or Casey at the end of the day. Most days I just use this under my eyes and on a couple of other places and no foundation. The sponge applicator that comes with it is pretty worthless, but I just use disposable makeup sponges and it works very well."
239467,5,"Girllll it is so pretty.  I bought it for myself..then gave it to a friend since I realized i would only be looking at the bottle since I do Shellac nails.  BUTTER release gel nail colors."
282054,5,"Great color. Would definately recommend"
112036,5,"I love these! The only self tanner I feel that isn't orangey."
360660,5,"Got this after I had rhinoplasty. I've always used strivectin. This product really got to the puffiness and discolor of the eye area."
20346,1,"Hard for me to rate the quality of the product.  I tried the pump 2 times (just enough to get it primed) and the pump broke."
23081,5,"good stuff"
161028,3,"I really can't give this more than three stars, it does work, but as for thickening my fine hair, not at all. It does clean well, but probably not something I would spend the money on again."
382353,5,"Perfect companion with the Molton Lotion !"
330141,5,"Essie does deep pink better than anyone we know!  This color is perfect for the beach or the bistro.  Go for it!"
507,5,"I was first given Gardeners as a gift in October.  I liked it instantly.  It's smooth, absorbent and smells great.  I wish more retail stores carried Crabtree and Evelyn."
497756,4,"Smell was nice but not as fragrant as other candles I have had from this brand in the past."
9440,5,"You will not be disappointed!! Makes my skin look flawless!!! Even my faded freckles. Light and great coverage!! Great price and lasts all day!!!"
261011,5,"Incredibly solid feelng. And since ts Italian it really seems like the Ferrari or Lamborghini of hair dryers. The motor is smooth and solid. It pushes out an impressive amount of volume of air. Even the cord is a more solid round cord rather than the two wires joined together in most appliances. Cord is more like a heavy gauge extension cord."
202379,3,"I was super excited to try this after trying and loving the Calmitude solution (toner).  While I liked this one, I didn't see the results that I see from the Calmitude toner.  This is a lotion texture probably best suited for dry to slightly dry skin.  If you have oily skin or very dry skin, probably not going to meet your needs.  That being said, if you have super sensitive skin, this may be worth a try as the formulation is gentle and somewhat calming. If money is an issue, I'd get the Calmitude toner and follow with a cheap, gentle moisturizer (like Cerave)."
435252,5,"work very well"
142835,5,"I have been using this for a year and I still love it.  I originally bought it on a cruise and my acne doesn't come back and my skin looks so healthy that people made comments after I lost 40 pounds and a lot of it showed in my face.  I look healthy they say... That's so cool.  I believe in this product and will continue to use it."
210512,4,"I've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff.  When it comes down to it, it's really just shaving soap.  This stuff is no different.  Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It doesn't have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it's a good low-frills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

Overall, the soap performs great.  There's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months.  It performs as well as TOBS, but 25% less expensive."
477293,5,"After having never used much facial products, I wanted to start taking better care of my skin. I saw this product and figured I'd make it part of my morning routine. After a week I can really feel the difference! My skin feels so much more healthy - especially after I moisturize."
219095,5,"I need a dryer that gets HOT, and this one does and it does not damage my hair.  I have fine, straight hair and need a dryer that gets hot enough to keep the hold when I round brush it.  Worked great!"
473401,1,"Does not work go to the store and buy something cheap same results"
60710,5,"There is no other product like it for my hair, and I spend half as much as retail.  I'll buy this as long as it exists."
194652,5,"We have used this product for at least 12 years"
404484,5,"Great product have been using it through out my pregnancy and have not developed any stretchmarks thus far."
456754,2,"Several things I didn't enjoy, very fragrant.  The lotion was very fragrant and also had an odd taste, yes taste, I could taste it even though it was only on my face.  And I do have a husband who also kisses me, he said it was perfumey and kind of a turn off.  The lotion also dried my skin out.  At first I thought, this lotion is new, I'll just give it time. I had already been using the serum for awhile, so I was surprised at how dry my skin got. By day five my skin was red and itchy and very visibly dry.  I gave it a few days off, and tried again, the same thing happened.  This is not a lotion for me.  I have mildly sensitive skin, oily in the T-zone, and dry everywhere else, my skin is neither mature or very young, it's in it's 30s.  I used as directed, with other Vichy products I had already been using.  This lotion was not for me.  Perhaps others will have more luck."
274187,4,"Works fine but not as good as my chi."
62333,3,"I've used the shaving cream before, purchased at a nearby Art of Shaving retail store.  Thought I would saving a buck or two by ordering a refill via Amazon.  When opening the container, I noticed that the shaving cream was not as moist and creamy as the prior retail store's container.  A month later, I was having difficulty opening the container. Next thing I know is the container broke."
75445,1,"I will never order this product again. The fragrance does not last. it was such a waste of money. It is not the same as what I had purchased from the Clean company. This is sad and I will not ever order again"
505888,5,"I recently started using this line of products and my face ( after just one use ) significant improved. I use the enzyme cleanser, aloe moisturizer, and a night cream. This facial spray is also amazing. You can spray as a toner, you can use to set makeup, and you can even spray in hair! Smells great."
193882,5,"Great moisturizer. I rec this because after I cut my face and use this with the wash, it helps alot! It keeps the face refreshed and moist. A little goes a long way."
140147,5,"Love this cream. I re-order it whenever I run out. It's a good quality brand and worth the purchase."
338549,5,"great product"
412312,5,"I've bought this shampoo and conditioner many times. I have curly, frizzy hair and this is the only product that seems to keep it
under control."
109912,5,"This cleanser will remove all your make up and eye makeup in one wash, even waterproof mascara. You will feel how deeply clean your skin is yet it won't strip your skin of needed oils. There is no need for an additional eye make up remover with this."
67062,5,"I have tried and ordered this product before and will order it again until it is no longer available. It is wonderful!"
237759,5,"My plastic surgeon introduced me to this product 3 years ago and I have been using it ever since. Excellent hydration plus no need to wear additional sunscreen."
84279,5,"My hair has been straightened with a Japanese hair straightener process so I have to be careful about the moisture balance of my hair. When I use this shampoo my hair always feels soft and it doesn't strip the moisture of my hair like other shampoos can. This stuff is pretty awesome!"
299703,5,"Works best for me."
401565,5,"A great product at a great price through Amazon!"
128081,5,"I have been using Nia 24 products for over 5 years. These are the only skin care products I will purchase going forward. I receive compliments on the evenness of my skin tone and this is incredible as I have much sun damage from when I was a young woman who spent much time at the beach and outdoors without adequate skin coverage or knowledge of its importance. The products have also helped with skin dryness, peeling, and helped my skin rejuvenate and retain a youthful appearance. Love these products."
75619,5,"I can tell that it is Authentics Juicy Couture. It shipped fast  and is of great quality"
180432,1,"I purchased this after reading many reviews. It wasn't my first choice but everything I read praised it so I thought I would give it a try. It was a huge letdown. The dial for the temp was difficult to move. Once I did get it set where I wanted, it did not heat up. I tried to straighten my hair (thick and wavy) and it just did not do the job. I sent it back and bought a croc. I'm LOVING my croc."
120377,5,"I cant live without this sleep cream. My skin is so soft after using it. It helps with my Rosecea in a big way. A great product."
229694,5,"I recently made the switch to double-bladed safety razors after finally getting fed up with spending an insane amount of money every month or so for replacement multi-blade cartridges.  I picked the 34c based on the other posted reviews, and so far I've found that this works very well as a beginner's razor.  The learning curve for getting an effective shave was rather small--the design is perfect for helping me to focus on properly and carefully shaving my face, helped by the weight of the razor.  Other than a couple of insubstantial nicks, by my second shave I was getting that ""baby's behind"" smoothness other safety razor users brag about.

This is a top-loading, non-adjustable razor, meaning that you unscrew the top and then place the razor in a fixed position between the top and the handle, which might turn off those who prefer the ""butterfly"" loading system and or ""adjustable"" styles.  Some of the reviews also express concerns about the small handle, so if you prefer longer-handled razors you might wish to go with a different model. However, after using long-handled cartridge razors for the last 18 years, I didn't find the transition to be difficult at all.  I can actually say that I enjoy shaving as an experience now--it goes to show that sometimes, the traditions of our ""fuddy-duddy"" parents and grandparents should not be so easily cast aside.

If this razor falls to pieces within the next couple of years, I'll edit this review, but for now, a big 5 stars for one of the best purchases I've ever made on Amazon."

259713,5,"Works great."
153052,1,"I actually really like Juice Beauty Green Apple Age Defy Moisturizer so I figured that this stuff would be good to.  Well, it's not.  It's crap.  I would not recommend this to anyone or ever buy it again.  If you're going to have a poorly performing product, at least make it not stink so badly lol!?!

The blemish clearing peel and the blemish clearing serum are both very smelly and sticky which is not a nice feeling to have on your face.  The only thing that I don't mind is the oil free moisturizer but it hardly even moisturizes.  It's just the least smelly and the texture is nice.  The wash just does nothing. Juice Beauty, you've got a lot of work to do on this line...love your Green Apple Age Defy Moisturizer though ;-)"

This smell is almost exactly the same and it actually lasts for a LONG time (u can smell it on u even the next day a little).
This is my new favorite cologne."
335164,4,"First time buying shaving soap.  Really like the aroma.  Feels great and is going to last a very long time."
36292,5,"I originally bought these pads for my son's acne.  Once I started using them I was hooked.  I swear they are what is keeping my skin young.  I have Rosecea and they do not irritate my face or dry it out.  I probably use them every other night.  Love them!"
141293,3,"Okay product. Good for setting make up. Feels like this one irritates my skin so I recently switched to the one in the green bottle and it's a much better product."
256898,5,"I'm always skeptical of these infomercial type products but this one looks like it is actually working. My gf is a hair stylist and had this product recommended by her beauty supply store to use on her clients. My hair has been thinning/receding over the past couple years and she decided I would be the guinea pig to try it out. I've been using all three products on average about 4 times a week for the past few months and it looks like my hair is starting to regrow. I took a before picture the first day I started and I can definitely tell a difference. I wish Amazon gave an option to upload pictures because I would upload the before and after. Full disclosure, I've also been using a 5,000 mg Biotin (Vitamin H) supplement daily as well. Its a little hard to tell which of the two methods is working but I'm sticking with both for now. The Biotin has also made my nails look healthier, my beard a little darker/fuller, and I've even had a couple people comment that my teeth look whiter. In any case I would definitely give the product a try if your hair is starting to thin. Regardless if the product is actually regrowing hair (hard to tell but appears to be), or just making the existing hair fuller and thicker, it does make a big difference."
364010,5,"Love this stuff! Worth every penny. I have very dry, eczema prone skin and wash my hands at least 50 times a day as a health care worker and this keeps them from cracking. Great after shaving too and my legs still feel soft at the end of the day. I also used it on my belly when pregnant-no stretch marks!"
487396,4,"I can't say it's substantially different in performance to the other, cheaper foaming gels one can buy at any given store, but this shaving gel has a really nice clean scent. It's fresh and crisp like a subtle cologne. So it gets points for that. Otherwise it shaves nice enough but you're getting a similar gel to what you can buy from target for like three bucks a can."
224222,5,"My boyfriend was excited to receive this gift! He liked the feeling of the bristles on his face."
8191,1,"CUSTOMER BEWARE. IF YOU DO NOT LIKE THIS PRODUCT YOU CAN NOT RETURN OR GET A REFUND...This product is terrible. It does not work as described. It is thin and watery. I would say a $2.99 cover up stick from a drug store works just as well. I tried to return to Seller, but they will will not give a refund on this product. Amazon is not helping either. Just flushed 37.50 down the drain."
395331,5,"I would recommend this product to anyone, I have dark hair with the grey roots that come out and as much as I would like to get my hair done every time one gray comes out, I cant, so this product is a great way to cover the greys in between hair appointments"
232740,5,"A great product endorsed by a leading consumer publication at a reasonable price."

478931,5,"I never write a review on anything but this product is worth it. At around 3 weeks old my son developed extreme baby acne. Although I know it didn't hurt him it was painful for me to look his little face like that. I did some research and found this product. Ive been using it for two days now along with a moisturizing lotion and my sons face has cleared up tremendously! I recommend this to any mommy out there willing to try another solution. Definitely worth it"
557825,1,"I am giving Olaplex a one-star review. Not this product per-se, and not Amazon's delivery service.

Here is the reason: check out the profiles of the ""professional"" who says this is ""FOR PROFESSIONAL USE ONLY"" and that it is ""watered down"" and will ""melt your hair off"" and that it is overpriced and the ingredients are wrong and it is the wrong volume etc.

Olaplex has a known history of filing lawsuits against individuals and companies who ""divert"" their product and writing fake and libelous reviews all over the internet everywhere this product is sold to anyone other than salons. They also employ underhanded ""patent thicketing"" --  the practice of patenting a product and patenting all possible variations of the product (variations they aren't even using) and patenting the ingredients and processes used to make the ingredients, etc.

Check this obnoxious drivel out: https://olaplex.com/pages/anti-diversion

""Diversion is a problem faced by many in our industry. When unscrupulous salons and businesses sell product on sites like eBay and Amazon, or to unauthorized customers, the entire industry is hurt. Olaplex takes diversion seriously and will terminate accounts, as well as bring legal actions as necessary to ensure the integrity and supply chain of Olaplex products.""

Corporations like this are frustrating because they are doing a service to humanity by creating innovative products which enhance people's lives, but they do everything possible try to short-circuit the precarious utility maximizing system of regulated capitalism.

Olaplex hurts small business salons by making them bid exorbitant rates to have the privilege to be allowed to use their product -- and salons which can't afford to maintain their account with Olaplex loose customers to the ones who can.

Olaplex hurts consumers by restricting access to their product and making them pay for the expensive service of going to a salon when there are creative individuals out there who enjoy creating art with their bodies, learning new skills, and doing things themselves.

Olaplex hurts consumers by spewing misinformation (LIES) on comment forums like this and misleading us.

Olaplex hurts consumers by suing corporations like Walmart, Amazon, and Costco for selling their products. This hurts us because (regardless of how you feel about big supermarkets etc.) cutting into their profit margins with exorbitant legal defenses means Amazon, Walmart, etc. raise prices and gives raises less often -- that's just what corporations do when they manage their finances.

Olaplex hurts consumers because they raise the price of their products and require more money from salons in order to pay for all of their Bizantine patent caveats, internet shill amazon reviewers, and belligerent legal attacks on corporate retailers and individuals on ebay.

Olaplex wants you to report anyone selling their product to ""legal@olaplex.com"" so they can throw money at lawyers to make hell for anyone trying to give us what we want so we can have nice hair.

And they say, ""We thank you for your loyalty and your assistance in protecting the Olaplex Brand.""

I, for one, am not emailing any leads to legal@olaplex.com, and I offer my sincere appreciation and support to our fellow rogue hairstylist ""product diverters"" on Reddit over at r/Ola************, and to Amazon, Costco, Walmart, and anyone other company willing to just say ""F you"" to Olaplex and distribute their product anyway, stand up to their shaky legal ground regarding retail licencing, and to pay bloodsucking lawyers of their own to meet this megalomaniac cosmetic producer in the courtroom battleground and win the litigious attricious pissing match and refuse to settle."

334997,5,"My favorite shaving soap.  Ever.

I use traditional wet-shaving (brush and double-edged razor) but this would also be perfect for cartridge shavers who want to add a bit of brush and bowl ritual to their routine for healthier skincare and a more pleasant shaving experience.  The scent is not overpowering but provides a cool, smooth shave.  Far better than any of the shaving gels in a can that I've ever used!  I almost don't need to use aftershave with this product, and I highly recommend the Proraso pre-shave cream to complete the system.

This is my soap, there are many like it but this one is mine."
473969,5,"Love this"
69941,4,"My initial reason for buying this was due to the high cost of AOS pre-shave, and wow I'm glad I did! It literally makes me feel their is a protective layer on my face as I shave using a DE razor. The oil is a bit thick, so just use a little."

118682,1,"For a new user of this cologne, you wouldn't know wether or not it's the real deal. But any normal user can the that this cologne is not legit. A price that is almost $30 below retail value should be the first clue. After receiving this product, knowing it was a knock-off, I went to the local Ulta and purchased a legit bottle for comparison. Surprisingly, the Amazon knock-off doesn't hide the fact that it is a knock-off. The obvious differences were the (1) ingredients listed on the bottom of the package were different; (2) the website listed on the bottom of the package was different; (3) the distributor was different; and the (4) bottle's bottom label was different.

Specifically:

(1) main ingredients oak moss extract and coumarin are missing
(2) johnvarvatos.com (Amazon) vs. johnvarvatosfragrance.com (Ulta)
(3) EA Fragrances Co. (Amazon) vs. JV Fragrances and Skin Care (Ulta)
(4) completely different design

The less obvious signs were, (5) the pattern of the leather wrapped around the bottle was different (diamond is vertical-shaped on Ulta and horizontal on Amazon); (6) the box texture signifying the leather-look was not embossed on the knock-off; (7) the smell was noticeably different; and  (8) the symbols and language through the packaging was misplaced and/or different."
216748,3,"I had a hard time getting the cream and serum to come out together once it started working right I liked the product pretty well.... now the serum has stopped coming out all-together and only the cream comes out.  The concept of this product is good it just doesn't work. It's kind of a pain to try and use, I wouldn't buy this again.  I've used the serum before so maybe I'll just order the serum by itself."
165424,5,"Life saver... My edges have been thinning due to certain hairstyles and it's been embarrassing trying to do updos with so much hair lose on the side.

219197,5,"When my 10 year old drugstore blow dryer died, I asked my stylist what she recommended as a replacement. She said she uses this model, so I ordered it right away. It came quickly and works sooo much better than my previous dryer. My hair is smoother, less frizzy and dries faster."

Her AA dark brown skin tone with darker blemishes from breakouts that when the break outs cleared left dark spots. My daughter was very sensitive about her dark blemishes on her face but after using this I noticed that I can hardly see them and they were very dark initially- even hard to hide with makeup!!!  She even took a picture of herself recently with no makeup and made the remark she was proud of it because she could hardly see the blemishes and was needing a second bottle!!. Yes ordering  bottle #2 as it was well worth the price and actually WORKS!!!!"

I have tried many many other peach shades and they are either too shiny or too pink in some ways or just too orange.
I would HIGHLY recommend this blush! And it arrived SUPER FAST!"
143499,5,"Never really looked much into face sprays or this brand before. Bought it to have a nice, refreshing spray during the hot weather months, and was suprised at how well it vanished away weird dry patches on my face while also setting my makeup perfectly. Gave a nice natural and dewy finish to my skin after applying makeup that would have otherwise looked too matte and cakey. Very good quality product. Will buy again."

182053,3,"I can't give this a big endorsement because it doesn't clean as thoroughly as it should. Great creamy lather that I work over my face for at least a minute, which should be plenty of time to dissolve makeup.  It isn't easy to rinse off either, I felt that took too long, too.  I then go over my face with a toner on a cotton pad and there is always a trace of makeup left. It also does not do much to remove eye makeup.  I have other cleansers in my arsenal that do a much better job."
19184,5,"works great."
214752,5,"good"
402206,1,"This has buildable coverage if you need extra heavy coverage. It stays on just fine. I gave it three stars because it settled into my fine lines and made them really prominent. If you have no fine lines this would work well."

38379,5,"I love this base coat. Even my chipiest nail polish last for days with this."

132861,5,"Good Product, but expensive!, no choice but to buy again!"

212743,5,"I have used straighteners for many years!  This one is the best!  Not only does it get through my thick, coarse hair with ease, it leaves my hair shiny.  I use it on max temperature and it does not damage my hair as other straighteners tend to."
346312,4,"I really like this product, it smoothed my hair, styled it and gave it a blow out look! It works differently than the UK version due to the voltage difference, therefore the one in America does not curl your hair like the UK version does more easily. All and all I like the product and I am happy with my purchase!"
432512,5,"Loved the matte finish and clean feeling this left after applying it.  Does not feel greasy like other sunblocks."
384231,4,"As one of the other reviewers noted, since this oil is made in the EU instead of the United States, you can trust the ingredients to a much greater extent. The EU operates on the ""precautionary principle,"" meaning companies bear the burden of proof to show ingredients are not harmful. America essentially follows the opposite course. Ingredients have to be shown as harmful to be removed. Another issue is that in America, many ingredients are considered 'trade secrets' that do not have to be disclosed... the most common being 'fragrance,' which can disguise a whole raft of poisons. Our system is based formulaic methodologies of cost-benefit analyses and quantitative risk assessments ostensibly offered to provide more 'sensible' and 'rational' solutions. In actuality, the system is motivated by a desire to accommodate industrial and producer interests not our health.

That said, the Elemis oil is evidence that you don't have to rely on cancer-causing or toxic products to smooth out your wrinkles and restore essential oils to your skin. This product works fine. No added smells, so on that front it is very mild. As a practical guy, the bottle seems to me to be a bit over-kill. I'd prefer a reduced price with the oils stored in a plain little brown bottle (to protect from the sun) and just a screw off cap. Turn the bottle upside down briefly on a finger tip and you get a full dose without having to mess around with a dropper. However, I presume they have done the market research to know people are more attracted to this bottle shape."

1804,5,"This flat iron works just as good (if not better) than all expensive professional flat irons I have ever had. I strongly recommend this product. I had the same model for about 5 or 6 years and it only recently broke at the handle (the actual flat iron still worked). That's when I ordered this one and it is exactly the same...awesome!"
391547,5,"My skin loves this product. Noticeable difference in my skin within two weeks. I have sensitive skin that easily gets red and blotchy with winter heat on in the house. I wake up with no redness or irritation. Lines are diminished."

160425,1,"I bought this product because I read much about how well it works.  Did not do a thing for me!  I'm very disappointed and wouldn't recommend it for help with a sagging neck."
249162,1,"I am VERY disappointed with this product. I have dry scalp and have tried almost everything to help it. I did more and more research and decided to try this argan oil. I really wanted it to work since the reviews I read were really good. So when I received it I did what the spray bottle said. I noticed that my hair was SUPER frizzy. So I figured it was me. Now I have naturally curly hair. Big curls - in ringlet shape. I never really have a problem with frizzy and I wasn't using it for that reason. I figured that maybe between my scalp and it also being good for frizz that I would have an awesomely useful product. OMG I was wrong. My hair looked HORRIBLE. I used it everyday for 5 days hoping it would get better. Each day my hair looked horrible. My big curls were frizzy as can be and my hair looked totally dull. It did NOTHING for my scalp since it was a spray. And it was more of a mist then a spray. I stopped using it after 5 days. It might work for people that have straight hair or really frizzy hair. But this did not work AT ALL for me. I was so bummed that it didn't work, but thems the breaks. I found Jojoba oil is fantastic and I switched to that. If the argan doesn't work try the jojoba oil. Everyone is different. And what works for me, may not work for you. Its a matter or trial and error. Good luck."

573647,5,"I'm a long-time fan of Japonesque.  Have you tried their layering mascara?  Do it. Try it.  This concealer is just as excellent. I'm chronically anemic, so I always have dark circles under my eyes.  Therefore, I always use concealer of some sort.  I consider myself a concealer expert.  Here's what I like about this one: it really is easy to blend and blending doesn't lessen the concealer' coverage.  After blending, I don't have obvious rings of bright concealer under my eyes and I don't have any shadows either!  As a bonus, this concealer doesn't irritate my skin or leave it feeling dry.  Honestly, it kind of feels like a moisturizer.

Try it.  I think you'll like it."
209856,5,"Like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around. Its a larger amount than I expected. Ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps. They last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them. This one is very pleasant, very nice shave, lathers easily (I have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1-5 its a 2-1/2) and Im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation. I have a tough beard that grows in many directions and I would definitely recommend this soap."

511942,1,"The package was split open and the product comes out from the bottom and the top. What a waste of money"
300318,5,"LOVE this sunscreen. It's light, non-greasy, and glides on great over my moisturizer. I started using it after my skin care specialist recommended it. I use it daily now and I love that it doesn't have that sunscreen odor many others do. This is a great company that makes quality products."
166127,4,"Have been using Toppik--a very good product for sure--during several years now, but amazon offers other hair fibers at a much better price. Spencer Forrest had best begin competing with its prices!"

494376,4,"A decent face mask. Leaves my skin a bit tight after I rinse and dry but it does leave it smooth. I haven't seen really much improvement but I'm sure I haven't used it long enough to get the full effect. I'll update in a couple more weeks."
460464,4,"It gives a very light tan"
159479,4,"Adds volume to hair.  My hair is very limp after washing, and this product is very helpful for styling.  I have to use another more holding spray afterwards, as I live in a very humid climate."
534687,5,"Recommended by my manicurist.  It helps in my classroom."
535176,4,"I loved the ease of the spray container and also am very impressed that it is 70 spf.  Most baby ones I find are only 50.  I will say that it was very oily so make sure to spray on outside!"
27142,5,"Great product!"
562038,5,"LOVE this hand cream! It is definitely the best hand cream I've ever tried. It is not greasy and the scent is very mild. It keeps your hands incredibly soft for a long time. This is my go-to gift; it's a nice stocking stuffer or hostess gift."
431453,5,"It's all I use as a face cleanser"
112875,3,"Missing brush or eyedropper"
35294,5,"Absolutely perfect. My hair is noticeably softer and less frizzy. It's powerful and dries my long hair faster even on its cooler setting. Well worth the investment!"
361616,4,"My daughter uses this product because she has reacted to others, and is very happy with this remover.  However, she finds the dispenser very annoying, because it seems impossible to remove just one wipe at a time -- when she tries to get one out, four more come with it, that have to be stuffed back into the packet."
117011,5,"I love the other Vichy products I've tried (the Aqualia serum is fantastic), but I was a little dubious about this cleanser, which claims to be able to clean, tone, and remove eye makeup. That's a tall order, but this cleanser delivers. It works really well on my tough to remove eyeliner and mascara. It's a very gently cleanser that doesn't irritate my sensitive skin or dry it out.

The package directions say to remove the cleanser with cotton pads, but the product info on Amazon says that you can also use water to wash it off. I use water, but that's just my personal preference.

I think this cleanser is a good value for the price. It may seem expensive, but you only need a small amount, so a tube should last several months. I've been using it for about a month, and I've barely made a dent in it."
157601,1,"Garbage"
408205,5,"This sunscreen was recommended to me. I used it the day that I ran for St Jude and that is a long day. I had to reapply it many times and you can see it sweating off but I did not get sunburnt. I would say it is well worth it if you are going to be able to reapply it at least every hour."
173571,5,"Really does smell just like roses! I use this right out of the shower before my pores close, and spray a little on right after applying my makeup. My skin wasn't really in bad shape before starting to use this, but my complexion has evened out, and it helps with my typical winter dryness."

91974,5,"I love this stuff.  I use it everyday on my feet when I am wearing sandals.  It isn't oily so you are not slipping in your shoes and it keeps your feet soft and moisturized."
481895,4,"I love beauty boxes so I am biased. I found some new goodies and some for men so I will give them to some guys I care about. I'm just looking for full size info so I can know exactly how to use some of these since they are small (the lettering etc).  This isn't too bad for $20 but I would have liked at least one full size item like most boxes offer."
111193,5,"LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!  I have tried so many different tinted moisturizers from the most expensive to the cheapest and this stuff is just amazing! Does not even feel like you have anything on, yet leaves your skin looking perfect! Super lightweight even for normal-oily skin which is what I have! Highly recommend this product! I have used their concealer for about 10 years now and I am so glad I discovered their tinted moisturizer. Wish I would have found it sooner!"
65361,5,"Buy this to avoid yellow armpits on your shirt."
205242,5,"I highly my friend to buy this product. It keeps lasting color between my monthly foils at my hair salon"
271164,5,"Bought this for my wife for Christmas.  After her first use of this Bombshell (1"") she said it was going to change her life forever.  She had been looking for a product to give her quality curls for some time. Finally she found what she was looking for. She looked amazing and she thought so too! The curls lasted through the night and into the next day.  One of the pluses was it took half the time as usual!  It has also changed my life forever as well, when mamma feels good everyone around her feels good too! And it feels great , dear god it feels great! As a husband this was the best decision I've made since deciding to marry my wife. 10/10 would buy again."
92432,5,"This is what awesome smells like. It makes my fine hair easy to comb through and protects it like a dream. Highly recommend!"
116685,5,"I love this lotion. Seems to help ease my breakouts. There is some water in it as other reviews have stated but its not a big deal. My dermatologist and esthetician both carry this brand and recommend it. Its very thick and creamy but not oily."
530866,5,"My mom has been using Guinot products for many years now. She mailed me a small sample ... I'm 32 years old, still batteling with adult acne and very dry-sensitive skin. I'm not sure why the other review post stated that this cream has an awful smell - DISAGREE! I love how it smells!!! Maybe she just got a wrong batch ... not sure but this product is awesome under make-up. It will dry quick so you can apply make-up over it very quickly ... Love it!"

Unfortunately it is very hard to come by lately. Dont stop"

77270,1,"Unfortunately this product did not work for me. I waited until I finished the entire bottle, and still didn't lessen the amount of hair that was falling out. I think it most likely works best with a hair supplement like biotin. But I have acne prone skin and can't take those since it makes me break out even more  :/ still on the look out to find anything that will help decrease the amount of hair falling out"
303295,5,"Use it every day.  Great scent, great value.  Highest recommendation."
94832,2,"Reviewers should have said this has a strong and distinctively masculine scent. The texture it gave my hair was pretty good, but I literally had to take a wet washcloth and rub it out of my hair because I couldn't STAND the smell!"
167371,1,"I wanted to like this product. I had read about it on a site other than Amazon. I was looking for a good product for my oily hair.  This product was so watery that I couldn't get it from my hands to my hair no matter how hard I tried.  I tried to use it several times, but I finally gave up and threw it away."
260180,5,"Great item, exactly what I wanted"
52872,5,"I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and let me tell you this for the price that I paid for it is a panty dropping cologne. I want to Jump my boyfriends bones every time he wears it. Not to mention he only literally needs one or two sprays & it last all day long. The bottle is huge and it literally could last for a very very long time even if you did wear it every day"
37388,2,"I've always used The Body Shop tea tree toner before, but as that ran out of stock I decided to try something different. I found the Herbal Mint Toner after alot of research on the internet. Sadly, the toner does not absorb into my skin quickly, and also leaves a lot of white foam around. I have stopped using it."

81573,5,"First of all I'd like to say that I have a serious lip biting problem. I have bitten all the skin off my bottom lip and my lips have been raw for months now and I've been slowly trying to stop because my lips looks like s***. Anyways this lip balm seems to help a lot in the healing process even though I've only used it once and it hasn't even been a full day yet, you can tell you have a quality product here. I applied it hours ago and my lips still feel great. What I like about it is that it actually keeps me from biting them even more which will help the healing process and eventually I hope to get all my lip skin back and never look back !! Recommend it to anyone."
144262,5,"My hairstylist recommended this exact curling iron.  My hair never held a curl ... and if it did, forget about it lasting.  This curling iron not only curls quickly, but also lasts.  My normal pony tail has been replaced (sometimes :-)) now with a longer hairstyle.  I wrap pieces of my hair around the wand, away from my face.  It makes soft curls going away from my face.  About 10 seconds each time for each curl.  I have gotten so many compliments and have sold about 5 of these now by directing friends (and even a couple waitresses at a restaurant who wanted to know how I curled my hair) to Amazon!  I even keep a picture of this curling iron on my phone now so I can easily send the link!  Definitely recommend this!"
361600,1,"Very disappointed. This lotion is greasy and did not provide a tan at all, after a week of use."
447482,1,"The worst!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY...If you are looking for a lip plumber IT DOES NOTHING!!!! BIG waste of money!!!! It's basically a very expensive sticky lip gloss!!"
430674,5,"Once you try any formula of Dermablend, you will never want to be without it. I am a woman of a certain age, and I have purchased just about every brand of cosmetics from dollar store to high-end cosmetics counter. Absolutely everything I have tried from Dermablend positively blows every other brand out of the water. There is simply nothing that compares to this line. It is easy to apply, and as you work it in you can see imperfections seem to melt away. Do not be deterred by the price, because in the end you will save lots of money. It is highly concentrated -- great color density with a light application. Of course, you can repeat the application in particularly troublesome areas, but the improvement is awesome. I am overwhelmed by the quality, and I am now a customer for life."
114436,5,"good moisturizing stuff"
34637,4,"very nice scent and definitely works better than the standard gels & foams out there."
36237,5,"This product is a lifesaver!  Since using this product, I've seen noticeably smaller pores and almost no breakouts.  I use one pad 3 - 4 times a week and after wiping my face, I'll run the pad on my neck.  Plenty of product per pad.  I have an oily T-zone and these pads help with that while not drying out anywhere else.  I used to have breakouts several times a month, but since using this product, it's once every couple of months.  The breakouts were around my face but now it might be one blemish only.  I was introduced to Glycolix through a dermotologist but since they are open only during work hours and are across town, I could not get there to refill.  Now I can do it on Amazon!  Highly recommended!"
396343,5,"This is great to use in between colorings. I have used it on the sides when gray starts to show and on top by my part. Just brush it on and it lasts until you wash hair. I purchased it thru QVC and then saw it on Amazon. I have found this to be effective for me."
247759,5,"This gel cleanser foams up very nicely and makes quick work of dirt and makeup. It leaves skin clean without feeling overly dry. That said, it might not be for those with dry skin types. LaRoche-Posay makes a cream cleanser that might work better for them. I have oily, sensitive skin, and this cleans effectively. Great to use in conjuction with acne products. I use this to remove makeup, and can use benzoyl peroxide or salycylic acid treatments afterward with no irritation. A little pricey, but a pea sized amount rubbed between wet hands creates enough foam for the face. I've used it daily for 3 months and have barely put a dent in it."
477432,5,"It really works. Within 1 week of use, there is a huge difference."

96640,4,"Can be a little greasy."
343646,4,"Tried this soap as an indulgence.  Not disappointed.  Just enough pumice for cleansing.  Awesome smell.  Even makes the bathroom smell good when not using it!  Makes your skin smell clean.  Too pricey to use all the time, but I really like this soap!"

414675,4,"Works good"
395501,1,"If I could rate this a zero I would.  Terrible, awful, horrible product.  No matter what it says it does rub off and stains your hands or whatever it touches.  Does not go on very easy at all.  Don't buy this is a waste of money.  I purchased this because I read this didn't not rub off, and it did."
354161,5,"Works great on my thick curly hair.  Works best for detangling."
324748,5,"Was exactly as stated."
114996,2,"After using the cream for over a year, I decided to try this to see if it would help with my continued breakouts due to rosacea.  I noticed a burning sensation upon application to my face. Within a week my peri-oral dermatitis had flared so badly that I needed to visit the dermatologist and get that under control. I only have mild rosacea, but this did not agree with my skin. I will not be buying this or any other pevonia products in the future, as they are now a flaring product for me, which is disappointing because I really liked the face cream.  I guess the enemy of good is better, right?"
422961,5,"I love this product and use it several nights per week to smooth and tighten the skin on my neck and face. The warmth of the light also feels good during the winter. LED is the way to go with fine wrinkles and crinkles."

180143,5,"great tool"
90979,4,"It's okay but you have to unscrew it to change the blade, but it is well made."
493536,3,"I thought this color would be different. first of all the shade is not my fav and the main complaint is that the color ends up looking uneven. you have uniform shade and then certain parts are a little darker. it is a cream, opaque in 2 coats. I don't like brown undertones in it. stays on ok."
199007,5,"Great product like always"
543042,5,"This is a great product. It does not flake. Makes hair nice and shiny"
556797,5,"After reading so many reviews from users saying this shampoo doesnt wash off well and weighs down hair, I was hesitant to try it. Went for it anyway and glad I did. This shampoo totally rocks and makes your hair smooth and soft. For the record- I have very very oily hair. I have no idea what anyone is talking about. This shampoo is awesome."
485327,5,"I got a sample of this a while ago, and when it dried out, I knew I had to buy the full size. This mascara is so great; my lashes look super long, and the color is a nice dark black. I've even had friends ask if I was wearing eyelash extensions. I did get used to the shorter wand on the sample, which is taking some readjusting, but this wand and mascara formula combo will make your lashes look long without getting clumpy spider lashes. The end of the wand is perfect for the corners and small lashes too!"

145297,1,"Not pleased at all with the BaByliss Pro. I smelled hair burning as I used it and did burn my hair ends.  As well with the side button it kept turning off.  I returned it right away. I would not recommend this to anyone."
307498,5,"I have been using this for a few weeks.  Rarely have I found a product that lives up to its claim.  This is an excellent product that I will continue using."
470907,5,"I loooove this product!! The smell is amazing! It works perfectly for my curly hair and doesnt strip it, just adds moisture."
460106,5,"I typically dislike facial sunscreens because they tend to feel oily and heavy. Im very pleased with this one though! Its light and my skin feels like it can breathe! Dont expect this to give you coverage like a foundation but, I appreciated the tint as I don't wear makeup when swimming or working out outside. Love that its a mineral block too!"
484511,3,"60 capsules of serum/moisturizer in a jar with screw top.

The capsules are a nice idea, but I'm not entirely sold on it. It's not that it is a hassle, but it's just an added step to my already ""beauty in a hurry"" attitude. It gives me a good amount of product to smooth on my face, but not so much on the throat and chest, however. The good part is there's no dipping my fingers into the cream and having too much, or contaminating the rest (though I always use clean hands and only I use my creams).

Applying the lotion is so very nice. Leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. There's no way for me to tell what it's doing at a ""cellular level"" because not enough time has passed for me to know what effect this will have on my skin long-term.

But a big negative is that it's way over my budget. At 60 capsules, two a day, that is a month of product for $54 (at time of this review). So $54 a month for a serum. If I thought it was doing really great things I still couldn't pay $54 a month. I could use it once a day and that would make it more manageable, but there are also other serums on the market that aren't as expensive and give the same feeling to my face and make the same claims. Perhaps this line of Cindy Crawford products does have better quality ingredients and some ""magic"" to it, but I still would have a hard time paying $54 a month for any beauty product on my budget.

Money aside, if I weren't concerned with my budget, I'm not sure if I would purchase. I really do like how it makes my skin feel but I have less expensive serums that feel great too. If I see that it does wonders for my face as time goes on, I'll come back to reflect that."
350255,5,"Finally--a curling iron that works!!  I just ordered my second one of this model as it works so well.  Other brands don't heat up but this one gets plenty hot and actually curls my very fine, straight hair. Well worth the investment!"

193442,5,"FYI.....I too was hesitant about ordering these Obagi serums off the internet due to all of the comments about the color being off...I did it anyway. I can tell you this, mine is always clear when I order form Amazon. I did notice that when I stopped using it and let it sit in my drawer for months it DID turn yellow. I thought hmmmmmmmm when I noticed this....Maybe the dermotologist offices have a slower rate of turnover than Amazon on their products OR is sits exposed in a display cabinet to the lights in the office and gets old and turns yellow.....So to the nay sayers, if you are worried about the color keep it in a drawer for several months and forget about it and it'll turn nice and yellow I promise : ) This is great stuff. I have ordered bottle after bottle in various strengths. It's a fact that vitimin c AND retinoid products change colors with age, when exposed to air and light........"
211045,5,"I noticed an instant improvement in my hair!  It's really dusty here, so my hair collects it.  Other brushes weren't really doing anything, but the first night I used this brush, my hair looked healthier and more shiny.  I wish I had spent more and just gotten the bigger brush though.  Now I'll have to wait until I feel I can spend a load on my hair care again before I can upgrade.  So, if you're thinking about trying out Mason Pearson by purchasing this pocket brush, I would say to go with the one you really want.  It's worth it!"

8833,5,"Perfect"
117148,5,"I am not a fan of make up remover. They always make my face feel as if it isn't clean, almost sticky. This does not. It left my face feeling clean and refreshed. It has a very pleasing aroma, spa-like almost, and easily removed my makeup, including my lipstick. I never put remover on my lips, but this felt so much like water and felt so clean on my eyes that I tried it on my Stay All Day LipColor. It removed it, easily. I normally scrub it away with a baby wipe. Red lips were gone with 2 cotton swabs. I don't use much facial makeup but I applied this all over my face and really liked the improved look of my pores. My skin was not left feeling greasy."

451286,1,"Have highlighted light blonde hair and my natural color is a dark ash blonde color. This product didn't change the color of my darker (relatively speaking) roots at all.  Absolutely useless for my hair."
302260,3,"Pricey and does not work well on short fine hair.  Leaves it without any body and rather flat.  Nice smell."
161129,3,"The product says it's Dark Lotion, but it doesn't achieve a dark tan.  It does provide a nice color....not orange, very much like a real tan, which I love about the Xen Tan products, which sets it apart from any competitor, as well as the fact that it doesn't leave much of a smell.

I wish the tan was  darker.  I have a light olive complexion and using this just darkens me about one shade.  Xen Tan products are on the more expensive spectrum of self-tanners.  I don't think I would purchase this again because I like a darker tan."
176974,5,"I have used the Hot Tools curling iron for years, the one I order from Amazon works great as always! I will continue to use this great product!"
364465,3,"It's oily for my skin type.
I think it would work better for the cooler months.
I don't think it will work in the warmer months because it's oily and might
make a person sweat more"
416747,5,"Barely there and spf40! I wear it alone with a little concealer or under foundation depending on my day. I use a foundation brush to apply. It has lasted several months 3-4, and I'm ready to reorder before I completly run out. I have combination skin with some very dry areas and occasional red flare ups. (that I haven't had since using this product.) This is very calming and gentle to my skin. I use blotting paper to take the shine off tzone area with this product."
122695,5,"Bought this set to use on my postpartum skin. I was breaking out due to hormonal imbalance all around my chin. I am new to this brand but decided to try it because of all the other good reviews on this site. It took about 3 weeks, but the cystic acne gradually went away. The  Buffering Lotion can leave your skin dry, so just adjust your usage accordingly. The Drying Lotion does not smell nice, but it works really well. My acne disappeared but the scars did not. I will have to use something else for the scars."
83598,4,"I like it, but its flimsy. not sturdy at all..  but does the job."
55871,5,"This is the only cologne that my husband will use. The price was great and I received it promptly. Thanks"
135717,5,"Great product and great scent!"
410477,5,"The skin on my face is super sensitive at the best of times, and given that it's winter my face is super-super sensitive and so after one application I knew that I would have to wait until later spring, when there is more humidity and my skin could produce enough oil to protect itself, to try this Retinol creme on the fine lines I now have.  My face became blotchy and irritated and I didn't use a lot.

SO HOW TO TEST?  Looking around I decided that the back of my hands would be perfect as they look terribly old.  Hot water, sun, gardening, etc. has made my old mom hands look very wrinkly and 'decorated' with some sun/age spots.  So good subject.  I chose one hand, the left, so I could compare and contrast.

Dark spots -- This Obagi Retinol creme has lightened all of the dark spots on the hand I used it on, save one, the oldest.  I can barely see the other dark spots now,  and I'm pleased with those results.  I'll continue with the remaining spot.  Perhaps being the oldest, it's going to take the most time and effort.

APPLICATION -- I use very very little of this creme.  For one thing, it is difficult to get out of the tube.  But I'm okay with that. This is an expensive product so I don't want to use more than I need to.  What I use is several pinhead size dots on the back of my hand.  I then rub it in.  The Retinol leaves my hand feeling soft and I've experienced no irritation.

*One of the things you absolutely need to do is wear sunscreen.  Even in the winter I've been using sunscreen on that hand as Retinol makes skin photo-sensitive.

WRINKLES -- This is where I've been pleasantly surprised and kind of amazed.  The skin on the back of my hand looks and acts younger.  It has less of a papery, dry and thin old-lady look and it definitely is showing fewer lines and wrinkles.  Even when I flex my skin in an effort to make wrinkles.

SUMMARY
I tested this on one hand so I could clearly see if there were changes.  The test hands now look different.  The one that has had the Retinol creme looks younger and all but one of the brown spots is almost impossible to see.  Can't wait to bring the other hand and my face up to speed.  From what I have seen, this product works."
513886,3,"Very Heavy, it would be good to put on when your just around the house to add moisture to your skin, You do not need much, I like it to put it on after the pumpkin peeling enzyme."

224273,2,"I'm not sure why I thought this would be much larger. It comes out to be this small little box and it looks like samples of each cream lol"
480400,5,"I love this product. I am a rashy mess (eczema, dermatitis) half of the time. This is one of the few products I can use that will not irritate my skin or cause reactions. It has no fragrance. It lathers very easily and richly. It leaves my skin clean yet not stripped. It is a pleasure to use. I can see how it would be terrific for infant skin but it is a blessing for my adult skin as well. I come back to this time and again as I know it is safe for my reactive skin. Wonderful."
38500,5,"I tried this a couple times now and it is very smooth to apply, dries fast and removes easily. I think it makes the finished manicure much nicer. More like a salon mani, without the price."

115069,5,"I normally never use the full amount of a product...they just don't seem to work as well after a while, but I'm on my 3rd tube of this and still love it! . My hair is wavy, so I let it air dry and what I like most is it doesn't harden like some of the other gels or mousse, and the nice smell is a bonus."
28604,5,"Color was glittery mermaid green. Wore it on St. Patrick's Day without feeling like I had Christmas nails. Zoya's a good quality polish."
161880,5,"This is a large brush so if you have shorter hair, get the smaller one. It works as it should, use a little product, take your time, and your hair will be full of volume. I opted to get this instead of a body wave. I saved so much money and trouble, this is the answer!"
569747,1,"Smells like cheap perfume. Couldnt get past the smell but also made my hair dry and crispy."
486394,2,"Started using this product, which I purchased from my dermatologist, many years ago. Then, it cost $15.00 for an 8 oz container.  After a few years it changed to $15.00  for 4 oz.  I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw how much the new price is and how little they are offering for that price.  Will be using a different product from a different company from now on."
572852,4,"A bit pricey for shampoo."
460181,5,"Love this sunscreen.  Goes on smooth, adds just a hint of color, and provides excellent waterproof protection.  Easy to apply without feeling heavy and greasy.  Recommended."
181388,5,"heats up fast and is gentle on my hair.  I am very satisfied with this product.  It is just like the one I saw at the salon."
251213,2,"The plastic broke about a year after I started using it, so I just have to throw it away. I disn't even get to the point to replace the pad. This was my biggest concern when I bought it, but I should've looked at the thin plastic closer. It was working fine while I was able to use it."

190264,1,"I don't know why this product gets such good reviews.  It is expensive and does not work.  My hair is thin and frizzy.  I tried it several times hair wet, hair dry, small amount, meduim amount, large amount, and it does nothing for me.  My hair still frizzes.  The texture of my hair is better without it."
174344,3,"Later Update -
The company helped to remedy the situation, still couldn't fully return the item. But, did reach out after receiving my review they extended what they could for a small company.- which was much appreciated

Just be aware you can't open the package for this candle and return.

DO NOT PURCHASE CANDLES FROM THIS 3rd party COMPANY Luxury 4 Him !!!
I purchased a candle from this company, the box the candle is packaged in was sealed with a ribbon.
 The only way to smell the candle, and leave the rest of the box in tack is to cut the ribbon.
The candle smell did not seem to represent the notes on the description page. I decided to return the candle. The company selling through Amazon ""Luxury 4 him"" advised they would not accept the return as the ribbon had been cut. I told them there is no other way to smell the candle and they said you would have to try and smell through the box. They are refusing to return a candle that has never been used nor did it state on the amazon page that they will not return if the box is open

If you like this brand of candle( which I do and have purchased before- different scent)  I would recommend buying from the actual brand retailer instead of this 3rd party company Luxury 4 Him ."

15532,5,"Plain and simple....it works like the description says it does. I used a lot of different products (shampoos, conditioners, gels, sprays, pills) to thinken my hair and this works the best. It stays in your hair until you wash it out at the end of the day and its not greasy at all."
344273,5,"Super fast shipping!  Item was exactly as described!"
183243,5,"Been using this 2 nights, and I can already see some improvements! Would totally recommend this for oily/dry combo skin. Smells a bit strong and bad, but it IS acid you are putting on your face... I will admit that it has done wonders for my cheek pimples. Would recommend!"
39791,5,"It's my favorite and I have been wearing it for years."
211694,5,"And quite simply, she does too. She recommended it, but I really do actually like it for myself. Its not overpowering like ""I can't breathe let me out of this elevator RIGHT NOW"" and its not too light like ""I wonder what that old lady with the flowery perfume was doing in this elevator"". Its strong, bold and crisp.

And she really likes it. So there's no loss there EVER."

453197,5,"I've only used this once so far, but my hair loved it! I left it on for about 35 minutes. I could already tell a difference while rinsing it out. I have a terrible problem with my hair falling out in handfuls due to medication, and i was thrilled that barely a strand came out in the shower, or when I combed it out. After it dried, it was soft, shiny, and had lots of body.  I only had to use a small amount because I have such fine, thinning hair, so it will last me awhile, so it will be economical for me as well. I can see how it might be a bit expensive for someone who has really thick or long hair, who would have to use a lot of product to adequately cover their scalp/hair."
14744,5,"I've used Strivectin for years...Works great for me...gives my skin a wonderful texture and feeling...I'm also not real wrinkled but, wrinkles aren't a thing in my family either, we are more the going to bag and get jowls type...This product feels the same on my skin, looks like the original coming out of the tube, smells the same,  but what I figured out is, it doesn't have the big ""K"" for Klienbecker on the bottom of the tube...Original Strivectin is packaged like that, they show a bottle like that on the picture here on Amazon, but when you get it, it doesn't have the ""K"" on it....That part they are deceiving you on, playing it off as original and it's not...What I've found out since is, its supposedly a generic of Strivectin, which is Striadril.  Which I guess you could say is the main active ingredient in Strivectin...As we all know generics are just made by different companys, but the ingredients are the same...The initial drug company has a limited time to sell their product under their costs and restrictions and no one is allowed to copy it during this time period...Im guessing Kleinbecker's contract is up with the FDA or something otherwise there couldn't be a generic of Strivectin now, unless this is being sold illegally, or it's fake, I'm not sure...All I can tell you is what I said initially, it feels good and the same, so I guess I'll finish using it....I just thought I'd found a company that was selling it for less, original Strivectin is $135, and I've found it from a few cosmetic places for $99 with tax and that's as cheap as I've ever found it other than here...Guess I should have known something wasn't right, but as far as I can figure out the ingredients seems to be the same, I've wondered if someone would ever make a generic of Strivectin, that is a legitimate generic... I'll have to research this more....It's up to you..."
571327,1,"Unfortunately spray that was sent to me doesn't come out. Can shake it and tell the tanning solution is in the bottle but only yesterday tried it for first time and doesn't work. Had bought dozens of times before and never had this problem so never bothered testing. Now obviously past eligible return date. Hopefully company will want it sent back to them so they can see for themself and send me one that works. As absolutely useless to me now.

556987,2,"2 Stars for Amazon charging $12 over the actual price of this item. This is usually $24 elsewhere. Excellent product for all skin types, but especially for mature or dry skin. For those with oily skin, it's an excellent alternative to actual oil cleansers if those scare you :)"

316717,5,"Comparing this to other travel dryers was going to use for travel with 220v where typically only ""low heat"" can be used.

See other products compared below.  KEEPING THIS!!!

PROS
=0.6lbs how do you beat that?!  All else compared were 0.8lb or 1lb
=small - looks like a mini dryer but the grip does not feel small
=elegant black
=powerful heat, really, side by side with the others, it was almost like the 1875 on both high and low heat settings
=surprisingly, the difference between low & high heat is as big as others tested, meaning, low heat is still quiet powerful considering it's a 1000watt
=is this really 1000watt??
=good low hum (not low noise, but lower than most)

CONS
=not foldable

These are the products tested  See specific Pros/Cons with each review but here's the highlight:

1. Cricket Pro 7144 Professional Friction Free Dual Voltage Travel Hair Dryer, (1lb) - loud high pitch sound 1600Watts
2.  Vidal Sassoon Vsdr5523 1875w Stylist Travel Dryer, Black (1lb) - great but found Babyliss much lighter
3.  Conair 1875 Watt Folding Handle Compact Hair Dryer (1lb) - feels heavier than other 1lb dryers even if exact weight
4.  Babyliss Bambino Nano Titanium Ulta Lightweight Hair Dryer, 1000 Watt (0.6lb) - soooo light, 1000Watt but quiet powerful, almost like an 1875
5.  Revlon Perfect Heat 1875W Fast Dry Compact Dryer (0.8lbs) - looks elegant, powerful, but fingers could easily slip fancy roundish low/off/high switch
6.  Vidal Sasson VS784 1875W Travel Dryer (0.8lbs) - good, looks like Revlon but better grip on switch to low/high/off
7.  Andis Micro Turbo 1600 Watt Dual Voltage Hair Dryer - White (33805) (0.8lbs) - good airflow but 1600w and looks a bit like standard hotel dryers"

496533,2,"I was hoping this would be the silver bullet but it didn't work for me. I have tried a multitude of anti-dandruff shampoos (all the usual suspects plus some) and thought this would finally be the one to do the trick. Nope. I also didn't love the scent. Better than tar-based shampoos but I wouldn't say it was pleasant either. On to another product..."
201292,5,"Great."
105781,3,"It's a good product, but a little over priced.  I have had white hair since my 30's, so over 20 years, and I have used many different products to get rid of the yellow hue white hair gets.  Klorane has been around for awhile, it does remove the yellow hue which makes white hair look dirty, but it last only about a day.  I have used other products that remove the yellow and brighten your hair for a good three to four days, and at half the price.  Don't get me wrong klorane does work, but the value for what you get is not worth it.

Would have given it a 4 stars if it kept my hair clean looking for more than one day.  Yes I do wash my hair everyday, because it's oily hair, but Klorane is to expensive for everyday use; and does have a tendency to dry your hair out if used to much.  I would suggest buying a hair product which has malave in it because it keeps your hair brighter longer, and is a better value.

Tip: For removal of the yellow hue, you can use just a shampoo like Klorane, you don't need to apply a white hair condition, its over kill and a waste of money.  Klorane and the conditioner you normally use is sufficient.  Using both doesn't extend the amount of time your hair stay bright.  The Klorane cleans the yellow out, so a special conditioner does not add any benefit other than the normal benefit of a conditioner! So save your money."

Purchased the 38C and Jagger DE8911 same day and I rotate both razors but over all the Merkur weight feels just right in my hands and the cutting edge seems to provide a closer shave for me than the Jagger. Nothing wrong with the Jagger, the finish is beautiful and I find certain blades work better with the DE8911 than the Merkur but my overall closest shaves are with the Merkur. DO yourself a favor and pickup a 38C and you will never look back."

I didn't like the scent and it made my elbows itch.

I love the mitt, and the browning effect. I have medium olive skin, and it did go brown instead of orange or bronze. This is truer to the color I turn when I get sun than other tanners. It absorbs very quickly and doesn't stain clothing."

This medium glow version is not that drastic of a tan, so if you're looking for a really dark look than you should probably buy a different product. I love this medium one for several reasons. First of all, its foolproof. It doesn't streak. Secondly, it provides such a beautiful, natural glow. It's not super dark but it looks like a natural, golden tan. It's not at all orange. I will repurchase this again and again. Love it."

To my pleasant surprise there is a very obvious difference in my skin texture. Even if I forget to use it for a day, my skin is so much more clear, dewy and taught . I will be buying a second bottle very soon, and will continue to use this spray."

I've been using this with a Cover Girl BB cream (the oil-control kind) and some MAC Fix+ spray and, well, it works fine. I do feel that for the price, it's far too expensive for me to be carrying around in my purse, which means it simply isn't available for me later on after I've been eating food, wiping my face, blowing my nose, etc. so the odds are that I won't rebuy it, simply because of the cost alone. But it would be great for a date night look or a photo shoot (yeah, right, at my age and weight?)."
43332,5,"Good!"
485822,5,"I use this product in the morning and at night and it seems to make my skin appear lifted and feel and look smooth. I only use a small amount so it will last awhile. This makes spending a little bit more well worth it."
188539,5,"Best face wash, hands down!"
509099,5,"Glad I got this as a LD! I'm hooked on this lotion now. It was nice to try all the different types before spending so much for a larger tube. The rose lotion smells very much like the rose lotions my great grandmother used to use. The shea butter makes my hands very smooth. Over all a nice assortment."
175076,5,"I love this stuff"
104392,5,"Great product. Pleasant understated scent. Decent lather."
470745,5,"First of all, product smells heavenly and also is a great shampoo. Very nice organic shampoo! Looking forward to trying some of the other scents and even the body washes and lotions."
235384,4,"Lotion is kind of thick so it's hard to spread it over a large area, but I mix a little bit of a thinner lotion to help rub it in. Burns a little if have scratches or cuts. Skin feels very soft and bright, would buy again."
365241,1,"My dermatologist recommended this for use after Retin A treatments. At first I thought it was the Retin A that made my cheeks so sensitive, stopped using that and continued using EltaMD.  After a few days figured out it was the EltaMD."
120949,5,"This is the best PRODUCT i've tried that has reduced my ingrown hair problem(s). I use it like aftershave, not in conjunction with any aftershave, and I have less ingrown hairs now. I also use the shave cream of this same brand. I started using both products at the same time, and the number of blemishes on my face noticeably diminished.
Just for reference - I have minimal facial hair still in my mid 30s. I still can't grow a beard because after a month it still looks like... garbage. I'm convinced my mixed Scottish & Cherokee ancestries are having a constant battle on my face. ""Grow hair!"" ""No, don't grow hair!"" I've had a frustrating amount of acne since i was 15 (20 years now), and over that time I've tried many products, medications, and procedures to reduce the number of giant red things on my face. The two Anthony products I use are definitely part of my solution. I've tried switching to a different brand, but had to quickly return to this one, despite how much I dislike the price. It's worth it.
I say this is the best PRODUCT I've tried, because there is something else I do beyond putting product on my face that seems to help me more. I use an exfoliating facial sponge (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Body-Benefits-Exfoliating-Facial-Sponge/dp/B0046HFFWG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Body Benefits Exfoliating Facial Sponge</a>&nbsp;immediately after I shave, in the shower, and that seems to help the most. But I buy them at bed bath & beyond for less than $1 per sponge, and sometimes even use one of their 20% off coupons."
108275,5,"This is the best curling iron ive ever used! Its amazing, completely worth the money!! Gives me beautiful perfect curls everytime, and very easy to use!"
314952,5,"I love this highlighter. It is extremely pigmented - I used a very light hand with a fan brush on the high points of my face and it lasts all day. The amount you get in the pan for the money is outstanding - it lasts me forever (~ 6 months+) I would say it might be a bit light for darker skintones - it starts to look somewhat ashy if I get a tan. I would recommend Betty-Lou Manizer for darker skintones, as it is a warmer and deeper (almost bronze), but has the same pigmentation and shimmer consistency."
42961,1,"I did not care for this. It is a very dry mascara compared to the Borghese - Kirkland brand that I  buy at Costco. I will not purchase this again."
145505,5,"I have thick curly hair and this works magic on it! Worth every penny."
441419,4,"As noted, I'm still evaluating this item and I suspect that long-term use will reveal its benefits, or lack thereof.  So far, I haven't noticed huge differences, but I did feel that my brows looked a bit lifted immediately after use.  It also seemed to tighten up the area under my jawline.  I'm talking about incremental improvement, but it does seem to help.

I also used aloe vera gel in addition to the supplied gel, so perhaps that could save you money once you run out of the NuFace provided product.  One does sometimes feel a mild tingling sensation, but hey it's electrical micro-current.  But it's not painful or especially unpleasant.

I'm going to try to continue to use this device daily and may upgrade, downgrade or add to this review depending on my future experience.  But 4 stars for now, as it does seem to offer some level of improvement."

341810,2,"This color is a lot darker than what is shown in the picture. It also has a dried on clumpy chunk on the brush that I can't manage to get off, making the polish difficult to apply. I like dark colors, but this is just ugly."

513840,4,"I like this cream. I like the texture, the way my skin absorbs it and I like the smell. It is a bit expensive."
19137,4,"the curling iron is great I should have ordered the 3/4 inch it is a bit small for the length of my hair but I am going to keep it anyway"
91314,4,"it is light and doesn't weigh my hair down.  that's is the main reason I keep going back to this product"
553621,5,"I received my toner today. Easy to understand and use. I have used program 1 on 60; this is more than half of the intensity. I plan on updating this every four weeks for 12 weeks and then post before and after photos. This way you can judge if the toner is what you want.  I've seen photos of the device but no before/after photos."
207878,4,"My skin is still oily and can get some blemishes once in awhile.  This really cuts down on the oil but does not really heal a blemish since its only on your face for a couple of minutes.  Good simple formula with a creamy texture and fairly inexpensive for a cleanser.  I've tried much more expensive benzoyl  peroxide cleansers as well as inexpensive ones and this is the best because of the simple formulation and value for your $.  I only wish Topix made this in a 2.5% formula hence the 4 stars."
389303,5,"I first found this at a very posh hotel in NYC and fell in love with it. This is a great body wash that isn't too drying and the scent is fantastic. Not too strong but leaves a nice finish. It's nicely gender neutral so works great for a guest bathroom."
54096,4,"Coming from a perfume addict- I like this! It's an upbeat scent! It makes me feel wild and ready for my day! The scent only lasts about three hours, but for those three hours, you can definitely smell it! I randomly chose this scent, but am happy I did. Would recommend.

 It smells outdoorsy, bright, and solid!"
135813,5,"I used this as an undercoat to one of their polishes the other day, and I was really impressed with the finish it left as a base coat.  The color is so neutral and nice that you could actually just do this with a clear top coat to let your natural nails stand out a bit.

But as an undercoat, it really did even my nails out and give a flawless base for color.  You can't go wrong with this."
155131,5,"I do a lot of traveling and often do not have time to wash my hair daily.  I have very strait, heavy hair that goes completely flat in humidity. Not only does this make my hair feel clean but makes it feel lighter and hold more body.  Smells really good too!"
72012,5,"Good stuff"
33821,5,"great item!"
206001,5,"This is exactly the same product that my derm sells under his own brand. Great to find it on Amazon!  I find the 5-2 works better for me than the 10-2. I use it am and pm to even out skin tone. Then i apply a good moisturizer.  Great combo for me!"
517899,5,"Awesome razor"
94221,5,"Im 39 years old and have been breaking out with large, painful pimples, often recurring in the same spots on my face. I have been miserable. I finally went to a dermatologist who suggested I use a glycolic acid-containing face wash and a prescription acne medication that is not covered by my insurance and would cost me $50 a tube. Before shelling out that money, I thought I'd try this buffering lotion, which I saw in a local Blue Mercury store, and which a sales rep there swore worked miracles on pimples. Since the buffering lotion cost just $17 compared to the $50 acne med, I thought I couldn't lose. But I was skeptical. Despite all the rave reviews I read online about the Badescu Drying Lotion (for whiteheads and blackheads--smaller pimples than what I have been getting) and this Buffering Lotion, I doubted anything could work so quickly. I was wrong.

I used the buffering lotion the first night on my two large, painful pimples, and I swear the next morning they were already smaller and not painful anymore. I used the lotion the next morning and evening, and by the second morning the pimples were half their size. By the third morning, they were all but gone.

I wish I knew this lotion was going to work so well so I could have provided a video time lapse review to show you how unbelievably quickly this lotion works. I honestly can't say if the lotion alone has cleared up my skin since I started using Glycol (a facial cleanser), and Dr Gross'  Extra Strength Alpha Beta Peel at the same time that I started using the buffering lotion. But, whereas I feel the cleanser and peels are making my skin healthier looking by exfoliating and toning the skin, I am convinced the lotion is clearing up my horrendous pimples.

This lotion is my new best friend."
421147,5,"I always try new lipsticks with a bit of hesitation - most of them promise to last and almost none of them do, at least for me. Japonesque is a new to me make-up brand, and this is the first time I've tried their lipsticks - in Shade 07.
It's a pretty wine color shade that goes well with my fair skin and dark hair. The case is very nice, a sturdy dark plastic that shows the color at the bottom and the top (helps to take away the guess of 'what color is this' if you have a busy make-up bag/case/drawer).
One thing I noticed right away is that the lipstick itself is 'curved' at the tip, or indented so it fits over your lip. This is very helpful to get that cleaner lip line when applying the lip stick, though it'll be interesting to see how that wears down with use. It's a nice touch.
The lipstick itself is very creamy when you apply it on and goes on very smoothly. There's no obvious scent or taste to it, and my lips don't feel dry or tacky as the day wears on. The lipstick does a good job of staying ON the lips without any bleed (especially good with such a dark color).
Japonesque Pro Performance lipstick does a really good job of lasting through the day and normal wear, which impressed me. There is a bit of color transfer to the lips due to the pigment of the lipstick, and again, it doesn't dry them out (guess it does live up to the moisturizing aspect). The performance and the fact that this lipstick is so creamy makes me want to try out more colors, as does the price. The current price of $20 is NOT bad for a high end performance lipstick at all.
Not too sure about the 'volumized lips' bit, though. Sometimes I feel a tingle, similar to what I get from the Buxom lips gloss, but not often. Don't know if they have a similar plumping agent in this lipstick or what..."
396868,4,"I really like this.  It gives body to my hair before styling and a couple of days after.  This is my third purchase."
72538,5,"My skin looks great!! I love it!!"
432490,5,"I don't mind paying for quality, but I am highly cost conscious.  So if I am going to pay many times more for a skincare product than a similar drugstore product, I want to feel confident that it is worth it.  As a 46 year old woman, keeping my skin as youthful looking as possible has become a high priority for me, and something I am willing to put some investment into--as long as my return on investment is worth it.  The Nia 24 skin care line definitely comes with a hefty price tag, so I did a little research to determine whether I was paying for hype and status or actual quality.

A quick internet search showed that the Nia 24 line is well-respected in the dermatological community and is generally sold only in physicians' offices.  It is a premium product that comes with a premium price tag.  It was started by a husband and wife team.  Both have PhDs in pharmacology and their life work for years has been researching the effect of niacin on human health.  They have published many papers on it in well-respected journals.  Based on everything they have learned through their many years of research, they started their own skincare line, Nia 24, in 2006.  It has been well-received by highly respected dermatologists.  Since then, including niacin in skin-care products has become more widespread in general, largely based upon the research findings of the Drs. Jacobsen, founders of Nia 24.  So buying their product is kinda like having Dr. Freud as your psychotherapist.

The main benefits of niacin in skincare products are thickening the skin (as skin ages it thins), reducing skin pigmentation, protecting the skin, increasing cell turnover, and having a beneficial effect on DNA metabolism, theoretically even reducing the chance of skin cancer.  All of these are well documented and either scientifically proven or proven to have a strong connection.  One of the drawbacks of niacin is that it can induce skin redness and flushing, including a slightly burning or tingling sensation.  Nia24 contains pro-niacin, a patented formula that greatly reduces the flushing issue in pretty much all people except the most highly sensitive.  This flush, should it occur, is not a cause for concern and will lessen with repeated usage.  I, myself, noticed no issues whatsoever.

The first Nia 24 product I tried was the Intensive Retinol Repair.  Long story short, I liked it and was surprised at how my skin just soaked it up, moreso than my usual retinol creams.  The Nia 24 Treatment Catalyst is designed to be used with any skin product, increasing its absorption and effectiveness.  You can put a few drops on your face before applying your other product, or mix a few drops in with your product.  I chose to put it on my face first.  It is slightly oily, having a light, pleasant essential oil kind of scent, and has a consistency that reminds me of a silicone hair product.  I would not recommend using it under makeup.  One of the benefits is that I used noticeably less Intensive Retinol Repair after I had applied the Treatment Catalyst.  So in that way it will really pay for itself, just a few drops allowing me to use significantly less of another expensive product, and helping that product to work even better to boot.

Since I started using the two products almost at the same time, I really can't say if the Retinol Intensive Repair works better with the Treatment Catalyst.  But since it is from such a highly regarded company and will actually save me money in the long run, I will be including it in my beauty regime going forward.  I am fortunate in that I have few wrinkles, but I will say that the light wrinkles around my eyes do seem to have disappeared pretty much entirely, even when looking at my eyes in my magnified makeup mirror.  I noticed that after only a few uses."
251554,5,"I had the famous Shu Uemura but could find no replacement strips to fit.  Anything mechanical needs replacing every once in a while so I bought the Japonesque based on reviews.

Its great  Not sticky or clumpy, just gives your hair a bit more texture.  The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that the pump is really hard to use.  You have to push down so hard, you lose control of where you want the formula to go.  Otherwise, its great!"

365111,1,"My search continues for a daily tinted moisturizer with SPF that will work with my rosacea...
I bought this after reading a rosacea forum post about the best moisturizers to buy for sensitive skin. This one came highly recommended, but I simply can't use it anymore.
It's itchy as soon as it goes on and dries out my skin so quickly that my whole face is flakey before I even hit the sun. I have to very consciously not pick at it when I'm outdoors... but that doesn't stop my friends from coming up to try to help me with the ""crumbs"" that I seem to be accumulating.
As soon as I get home, I need to wash it off, but the flakes are so large and damaging that putting Cetaphil on afterwards simply BURNS.

In short, this moisturizer does more damage than it prevents."

423980,4,"The value of the product can't be beat considering the amount you get. I found from experience that a little amount can go a long way and I know this will last me for a long time. As others have mentioned, the gel can be reactivated with some water. For me, the product is strong enough that it lasts through a night's rest in bed and I can still look presentable in the morning if need be.

Overall, I am happy with the value. It's not on par with some other high-end hair products on the market, but if you're on a budget and want something that lasts a long time, this is worth purchasing."

However, I've used this on average 3-5 times a week.  This has lasted much better than my top of the line Chi ever thought about giving me, and I will definitely look for this brand again (if not purchase this exact one again!).

As the sister of a very sweet cosmetologist, she always makes sure I have the absolute BEST of anything hair related - shampoo, conditioner, flat iron, curling iron, blow dryer, etc.  With that, I had a Chi blow dryer, top of the line, ionic, you name it, it had it!

I do have thick, long hair.  But it takes forever to dry, so I had used it very LIGHTLY for 1 year and 3 months before something went bad and it no longer heated (a very common problem).  Let me stop here and clarify light use on thick hair - I wash my hair about every other day.  I would use the Chi to dry my bangs (short) and just the very top roots, not even the top layer, just the roots.  Sometimes at night, I wouldn't use the dryer at all and let my hair air dry then use the curling/straight iron the next morning.  It probably had an average use of 10 minutes a week.  The warranty (though very lame) is for a year, so I called and they were basically no help (barely understood English).  I thought after all the money spent on Chi's (and how many my sister had sold for them), they would be of SOME help.

I couldn't spend money on a Chi again, just to have it go out with very light use in just over a year.  So I go to trusty Amazon for reviews... now, I can't buy a no-name brand because everyone who comes to my house expects me to have the best in hair care products (even my mother in law commented on how I have the best ""stuff"" and she loves excuses to stay and use my shampoo and conditioner lol).  So I found this one, a professional brand, I love my Hot Tools curling iron, with BETTER reviews than the Chi, Helen Of Troy, and all the other high ones - but with all the features.  Plus, I can order 4+ of these for the same price as one junky Chi - so I'm not in tears if it goes out in a year.  Of course, I place the order still terrified, ""What if it's not as good as my Chi???""

I have been using it for about 3 weeks.  And to kick it all, I like it BETTER than the Chi!!!  It will actually dry my full thick, long head of hair straight out of the shower in 10 minutes tops.  Which is wonderful, since I have a 7 month old and now I can go to bed with dry hair without spending all night trying to dry it.

I know it sounds like I am a paid advertiser for them.... but seriously, I'm that sold on this blow dryer and think everyone should know.  Adios Chi brand..."
522383,5,"My favorite massage oil ever! The smell is soooo relaxing! Goes on smooth to ease tired muscles. Also nice to put a few drops in your bath water! Ive used it for years!"
407426,3,"I have had this little machine for a while now, but never seem to find the time to use it regularly because it is loud and the flash is obnoxious (can't use it and watch TV).

I had professional and painful laser hair treatments on my legs years ago and although it was nearly unbearable, I made it through all the treatments and had super results.  To give some reference, after the professional treatments, hair did not grow back on the treated area for about six weeks...none of it.  It also hurt like a b****, they did the treatment through some cooling gel substance and I had to wear protective eyeware the entire time.  So....I am guessing this little device is not nearly as powerful or effective as a treatment it an office.

I use this device on the highest setting and feel barely any pain, except when I accidentally hit the same area twice.  So far, I always have some hair growth immediately.  Rather than eliminating the hair in an area, I find this is more of a thinning effect.  I also think it is difficult to ensure you get total coverage of an area, it is hard sometimes to see which area you just zapped before moving onto the next.

If your considering this, I think it will work eventually, but it will take time, patience, and commitment on your part to use it regularly.  It might not be the best deal for a really large area like legs or chest because it just takes so long to complete an area.  Also, even though the device is completely against your skin during treatment, there is still a visible laser pulse and I wear protective goggles as a precaution even though it does not state you must.  I only have one set of eyes and an eight dollar investment in goggles seems like a small price to pay to protect them.  I do like that the device plugs into the wall and does not rely on battery power though and there is a small lag time between charges (where the machine is able to pulse again).

For smaller areas like underarms, bikini, upper lip and the like, this is probably much cheaper than professional treatments and a ton more private and for that reason alone I really like it.  However, for the effort involved, I am not sure it is not just easier to let someone else do it for you and be done!"

336020,5,"I bought this after running out of the BB&B Bigelow stuff (which was great).  I prefer the smell of this one and, I may be crazy, but I think it actually works slightly better than the green-box bigelow stuff.  So, this is my new shaving cream. I thought they were the same 'recipe', so maybe my perception of this being better is nothing more than forgetting how great the other is after using other things for a week.  I haven't tried this with a brush yet as I have found that I get good results applying it directly do my face and rubbing it around.  I use it in conjunction with feather blades and a WSP handle.  Also, I used quality brush/soaps before discovering Bigelow and went through 2 small tubes and 3 large tubes of it before buying this.  I will probably stick with this now as I like it a tiny bit more than the green tube bigelow."

573601,1,"Because Obaji's sun screen was so good, I thought I'd like their cleanser, too. Nope. It has several problems, none of which is  necessary for exfoliation.

Mechanical exfoliation is simply bad for everyone's skin. It increases oil production and causes micro-tears in skin. I didn't even know this one had ""beads"" in it, or I wouldn't have tried it in the first place. Still, since I wanted to write an honest review, I used it against my better judgment.

The second problem is that it contains fragrance. There's no reason to add fragrance to any skin care product, let alone one that's going on a roughed-up skin. Lose the fragrance, Obaji.

There's no reason to add a foaming agent, either. That's added because consumers have been taught to expect a lather or foam to make things clean. Very good facial cleansers don't foam up, they just remove dirt and oil. When you consider that we already have ""beads"" and fragrance in the product, there's absolutely no logic in adding yet another unnecessary ingredient with the potential to cause even more skin problems.

Finally, while the second ingredient is a chemical exfoliant, there's amount listed. Thus there's no way to tell if it's strong enough to actually remove those top-layer skin cells as an acidic agent should do.

I'm going to stick with BHA (beta hydroxy acid, a/k/a salicylic acid) for the oily areas on my face and AHA (alpha hydroxy acid, such as glycolic or lactic acids) for the rest of it. They're cheap when bought as stand-alone products at a drugstore, and usually won't cause irritation unless they're used too frequently for your particular skin. Following up with an inexpensive and non-irritating cleanser such as Cetaphil or one of Paula's Choice products, and your skin is clean."
420374,5,"If you plan to use the St Tropez mousse (or any self tanner, really), I highly recommend you skip your morning lattee and fork over the $6 for this mit. Is it actually worth $6? Probably not. But it makes a huge difference.  I've never self-tanned before, and was so happy I followed the recommendations and bought this for the application. It helped the product go on smoothly and evenly, and there were no weird blotchy spots or orange hands.

Tip: I followed this method from other reviewers using the St. Tropez mousse with this mit: two pumps for calves, two pumps for thighs, two pumps for stomach, one pump for chest, two pumps for arms, two to three pumps for back, half a pump for face :)"

279433,5,"I am really pleased with this product. I do believe it lightened freckles and areas showing age. I was given a tester at an event and each time I used it I thought I saw results. I decided I wanted a full bottle. I think the scent is nice and the texture is nice. My skin feels very clean with it.  Your skin will feel a little dry so follow up with a moisturizer.  I later started mixing it with an exfoliator followed by RetinA and cream. Together it's a great regiment."
126269,5,"I love this hair spray.  Since I first found this brand and type several years ago I refuse to use anything else.  Yes it is a bit pricey but it works great!  I love how lightweight it feels,  It lasts all day long without breaking down.  I also like the smell too.  It doesn't have the strange alcohol odor that some do.  Overall a great product.  No complaints at all about it."

DONT BUY THIS."
89444,4,"Many great reviews here I will add one more.  I was hesitant to switch back to the safety razor after so many years of paying so much for the 4 blade razors.  upwards of 25.00 for a pack of 4!!!  Well I decided to dive in after reading the reviews and doing the research.  Basically for those of you who are hesitant.  There is a learning curve to the mindless shave of the 4 bladed scrape your skin off razors of today.  You need to think about how your face and beard is.  I would also suggest if your nervous watch some you tube videos about shaving with a safety razor and the correct angle.  Invent in a nice shave cream that has a good lubricant.  I went with Cremo and its great so far.  Still testing others though.  Plus get yourself a nice blade.  Many hear are reasonable I picked up 100 for 10.00.  Also, the other reviewers are correct when you reload the blade in this razor you will need to hold the top parts together with some force while you screw the handle on to ensure the blade is seated in the right position!!!  Big tip with this razor, fortunately I read that before I used it and so far no cuts.  Just put the top on the counter place the blade and the back plate then hold it at each end down with some force and screw the handle in.  After two weeks of trial and
error and finding which way my beard likes to be shaved I can shave in just about the same amount of time it took me to scrape my face with the
 other blades.  Really when you start using a safety blade you will wonder why you did this any other way.  my skin is much softer with less irritation and redness.  This razor is easy to handle and well balance weighted so you will get used to it quickly."

359498,5,"First off, I think the packaging is really smart.  Different elements and clip together to form a palette.  I'm planning on stocking up on a few more Jouer products so I can make a nice travel compact.

I love the consistency and color of this blush.  It blends really well and is very natural looking.  It's a lovely cream blush, and I apply it with my fingers.  I like that it's a small size.  This makes it very portable for travel.  My skin can be fairly sensitive, but I haven't had any reactions to the Jouer products I've tried."
509877,1,"If you are able to pay for this, I really recommend you to use botox or something else because you will not see any particular result using this product."

137563,4,"This facial cleansing soap is not what I expected. It has fine granules - somehow I missed that in the description. I wanted to use it to remove my makeup - but with the granules I have to remove my mascara separately. Having said that, my husband grabbed the bottle and adores it. He has dry skin and this formula does not strip or irritate his face."

381273,5,"I have thick colored blonde hair well past my shoulders. Hate washing it every other day because it's a process. I'm not a fan of conditioner all the time, so if I don't use a detangler it takes me 15 minutes to comb through. This shampoo is fantastic. My hair does not look like a birds nest when I'm done washing and the shine is fantastic. Better than almost every shampoo I've ever tried. And believe me, I've sampled everything from cheap to really expensive. If you spend a fair amount of money coloring your hair and want it to remain looking nice, I definitely recommend this product."
489028,4,"I've given this 4 stars because I haven't tried the curling aspect of it yet.
I have thick curly hair and after my flat iron AND curling iron died on me I needed to invest in something. I hate going to the hair salon.
I got this and it was a little hard to get used to at first but it works wonders!
I air dry my hair and then blow it out lightly to get out the kinks; I flat iron/curl.

I know the price is steep but use very very little or you will notice it on your face near your ears.  Try to get 2 or 3 samples (enough to last a month) then try it.  Be honest with yourself and the product.  Cleanse your face morning and night - then apply."

This is not the case as it clogged my machine and took me a very long time to clean it. I have to use my fingers to apply it which defeats the purpose of why I bought it. I would also suggest buying one shade lighter as the shade I bought is very dark. It does have a nice feel and finish but I sure wish I could apply it with my airbrush system."

So I did what was recommended by someone else and I got Couvre (made by same company) in dark brown to use on my scalp first (it also covered my gray roots) and then when it dried I used Toppik.  Together they worked GREAT!  I was using just a black hair spray and it was making a mess everywhere!  It left over-spray on everything and turned the necklines of my sweaters and clothes black and was a mess. If I touched my hair at all my fingers were black.  This doesn't come off on anything and I can touch my hair!  I was even in a rainstorm today and it didn't run. You cannot tell I am thin at all! It looks thick and nice. I am much much happier!

This is the first product that does it all - I use it before blow drying to protect my hair from heat/tame the frizz, then after blow drying to make my hair receptive to straightening. Sometimes after straightening to give it body and definition. (Usually not all 3, because it's very thick.) It's really great for giving your hair definition. Hair looking meh?

The tiny spoon is adorable, and helps measure out the amount to use.
The cream is very liquidy, so keep the lid on tight.
It plumps the skin up nicely before heading out the door.

531223,4,"LOVE the Smell and the fact that babys skin feels so silky while in the water although after a week of using my baby still a couplke of hours after a bath and lotion has a dry looking and feeling face has helped with her body though, maybe because her face doesnt soak in the water with oil just gets wiped off. Not sure but overall i do recommend..! Also baby will slide around in the tub can't take hands off of baby which is a little nerve racking!"
152453,2,"I knew it would not be successful when reading the first ingredient was water.  It did not work for my dry, frizzy hair."
417663,5,"I love this shampoo. It is perfect for colored hair.  Not only is the shampoo great for your hair, it lasts a long time because only a dime-sized amount in your palm is needed each shampoo.  My hairdresser recommended, and I haven't changed in five years."

462867,5,"I usually don't do beauty sets. The last time I had one was over 20 years ago when I was back in high school. Usually, I just mix and match products from various lines because even though I have very oily skin, most sets have at least one product that is too harsh and drying for my skin. Therefore, I didn't have high expectations when I ordered this bliss set. However, I was pleasantly surprised. This is great. The star product here is the peel. Unlike similar ones I have tried, this didn't sting my face or irritate it. I saw a difference in my skin after the first use. The cleanser is gentle and removes all make-up and while I usually don't use any creams on my face except for sunscreen, sometimes the cooler weather does dry out my skin. This one is lightweight enough for my very oily skin without turning me into an oil slick. Over all, very well done! Would make a a great gift."
230167,5,"I love this product. It does not run. My lashes don't come out when I remove the product. Just soap and water works fine. I have oily skin and this does not raccoon. Good price. I would never put discount or drugstore products near my eyes. Looking good costs money folks."
64228,3,"I believe the quality has gone down with this model.  I bought this as replacement for the same model dryer.  This one moves much slower and the ceramics inside make a clicking sound as it's cooling which the prior dryer never did."
372978,5,"Just purchased this for my son's cradle cap after using coconut, olive, jojoba oil and calendula cream. while all the natural treatments helped some, this shampoo is miraculous. two washes in and scales are becoming loose and flaky and easier to remove. and his hair smells great and looks clean. i also loved the mustela stretchmark cream so i will be trying more from this product line."
97812,5,"Loving this file!"
330042,3,"Okay. I wore this color once. I didn't really ever use it again. I didn't hate the color but I guess I was't in love either since I keep choosing other colors to wear besides this one. Maybe I'll give it another shot. Also, it does have a slight shimmer to it, which I am not a big fan of so maybe that was it for me."
52009,1,"I ordered Chi Silk Infusion from Instant Beauty Supply.  It appears that this product is not the real thing (I was warned by Farouk Systems, but chose to purchase online through Amazon anyway).

35213,1,"When it's working it is a very good hair dryer.  It burns out a lot after 5 minutes of use, so I'm afraid it's going to die and I just got it less than a month ago. It's definitely the blow dryer and not my outlet. I try to reset it and plug it into other outlets but it still doesn't work until hours later.  It's a good thing it's summer and my hair is thin.  I can use it long enough to 1/2 dry my hair but I don't like that it just turns off like that.  I don't even use the high setting, I use the low setting and low heat.  It worries me."
531398,4,"This product works wonders"
350899,5,"Love this stuff. LOVE IT. Goes on perfectly, doesn't flake or come off during the day... you know how some mascara will flake and get into your eyes? Not blinq. It creates a tube on your lashes that stays put ALL DAY and only comes off when you wash your face or shower. And even then, you don't have raccoon eyes - it's like the product melts away with no residue. It's wonderful. I got the black and love it."
437070,5,"I write few reviews.  As a mom of 3 small kids and owner of a business, I don't have time.  I am taking the time here. This product may not be for everyone but, maybe it should be for everyone.  For those of us that highlight, use hairdryers, straighteners, irons etc, and struggle to maintain your healthy-looking locks, this product is for you.  I typically don't like my hair the first day after a typical shampoo/conditioning treatment (I use high quality shampoos/conditioners).  Shampoo strips it and conditioners try to put the essential ""oils"" back in.  For me, my hair is too clean and less healthy looking.  I have always liked my hair on day #2. So, again, if you are like me, this is your product.  Your hair is left clean and yet not feeling ""stripped.""  It looks healthy and after drying and styling it, I feel my hair is the healthiest it has looked in years.  It is expensive but, no need to buy conditioners.  I also have to use less products....less ""frizz control, shining serums, etc,""  Therefore, maybe essentially I am saving money.  If you are looking for CONS....and I struggle with this one..... I DO feel feel as though on Day #2, I like to put a touch of dry shampoo at the roots.  But, that is easy and I am good to go.

This is NOT the product if you feel as though you need to shampoo your hair every day.  You may like that ""stripped"" down version of your hair.  I don't and I bet there are many others like me out there."
336129,4,"The shave itself from this product is very soft and smooth.  I wanted to try one of Proraso's non-mentholated products as the menthol can be very medicine like in odor.  The fragrance is okay but not great with this product but again the shave is nice.  I still prefer the scent of Musgo Real from Portugal vs this Italian product but the Proraso seems to have more moisturizers.  I don't regret the purchase but want a cleaner lighter fragrance.  It may grow on me as I use up the tube."
7630,5,"I have been using this for over 20 years for a 3in hypo pigmented area.  I have sampled only a few other name brands over the years just to see if anything is better but found that this works for my skin tone.  This is my first time ordering it from Amazon. It can last me more than a year. Works best with the setting power."
118126,5,"HI, i discovered the Epicuren line of products accidentally at a spa in la. and ever since, i ve been using not only the lotion but skin care as well. the lotion (after bath moisturizer) is amazing! i had a baby a year and a half year ago and the skin on my tummy didn't have stetch marks but it was just stretched out from the baby being there . well after  the baby i tried a lot of stuff but when i started using this lotion, it healed my skin. it stopped sagging. im not kidding. i mean i did exercises for abs etc, but u cant stop skin from sagging just by excersising. anyways i don't use anything but epicuren cause I LOVE IT and THE RESULTS ARE WHAT MAKES ME LOVE IT. i hope this helps"

471641,5,"I received my Clarisonic directly from Amazon so I am 100% sure it is authentic. Be very careful if you are buying from 3rd party sellers, there are a lot of inferior fakes being sold online. I have always had oily skin. Through out the day I have always rinsed my face with water and sometimes with a mild soap. I always thought I did a good job at getting my face clean. I was so wrong. I realized that I was not getting all the dirt off with my hands. After using the Clarisonic for the first time, my face felt amazing. Right away I could feel the difference. I used the medium setting to remove the oil deep in my pores. When I am done my face feels smooth, clean and oil-free.

The Clarisonic Smart Profile is their top of the line model. You can tell that it is made with pride in the USA. It is feature packed. There are four speed modes plus a turbo mode. Also each smart brush head auto adjusts the Smart Profile's performance. The smart heads will also illuminate the replacement head indicator when it is time to replace the head. The unit is also rechargeable and fully waterproof. This is great because I can use it in the shower which I do every morning. It comes with two brush heads for your face and body, the Smart Profile unit, USB charger, three year warranty and directions."
351369,5,"This was a ""blind buy,"" having not tried it at all. Of course, I did my research and read many reviews. The cedar and vanilla notes are clearly distinguishable and the cologne does not smell ""artificial,"" at all. Of surprise was discovering the longevity was quite good; on my skin, colognes just sort-of soak in, but L'Occitane Eau Des Baux stays with me for plus/minus eight hours. Oh, and the price was right, too!"
421700,5,"I've been using my Nu Face for a month+ now and it has worked for me.  I noticed an improvement quickly.  I agree to have to keep it up.  One note, I am susceptible to broken capillaries on my cheeks and have had them treated in the past with photofacials.  Use the lowest setting for these areas.  I *thought* I was seeing them return, panicked, called my dermatologist and they said use the lowest setting and not every day on these areas.  I can still use this on my neck, forehead and eye area.  I've seen the biggest improvement on fine lines around the eyes."

442556,5,"This turned out to be a great product.  I have used various self tanning products before and some were OK and some were not good at all, therefore I really had no true expectations.  I was pleasantly surprised at this particular one.  The lotion itself goes on smoothly.  I will add, for review of this product we received the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/XEN-TAN-Deluxe-Tanning-Mitt/dp/B002UOCTSU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">XEN-TAN Deluxe Tanning Mitt</a>&nbsp;which is not normally included with the product purchase.  I would however recommend purchasing and using the mitt to apply the product as it helps tremendously with applying it smoothly. The product went on easily and the smell is pleasant and very low key, unlike others that have an over whelming processing odor.  Marilyn

The tan did settle in naturally after a few hours and looks very real and natural.  It has no orange fake tint to the coloring. Even after a few days, the tan still looks good.  Also, the biggest pro is no coloring on my sheets or clothing.  I can't boast enough about that as even the expensive spray on tans I've received have left coloring on my clothes and sheets.

Overall assessment:  The product works and does exactly what it claims!  It looks as good as the tanning salon spray on's.  It's not cheap, but spray on's at the tanning salons run approximately $20 - $25.  Therefore, if you get at least 3 tans from this tube then you are probably ahead.  No stains left behind on your sheets add even more value to this product and actually make it better than the spray on salon ones.  I highly recommend this product and purchasing the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/XEN-TAN-Deluxe-Tanning-Mitt/dp/B002UOCTSU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">XEN-TAN Deluxe Tanning Mitt</a>&nbsp;that is sold separately."

The only thing I would not recommend is placing this solution on broken skin- a pimple that you just finished popping. Make sure not to mix the bottle as you don't want the solutions to interact. When you get to the end of the bottle you may need to purchase a Q-tip longer than your average Q-tip so that you can reach the pink solution towards the bottom of the bottle."

Sometimes when I miss a day or two of application my face is still glowing. So it doesn't seem to disappear immediately.

I've been using Toppik for over 3 years now and it's my life saver. I'm a female in her 30s with thinning hair at the top of the head. The key to this product looking natural is not simply shake it on top of your hair but to lift a strand at a time and add a small amount of Toppik at the root line, then lift the next strand and so on. I finish it off with a light coat of hair spray and it lasts until my next wash (3-4 days)"

Maybe it is from outside reasons like stress, but I did break out a little on my face, so I will have to try it again when things calm down and see if it still causes the same issue."
218448,5,"I don't think I've ever really put any thought into the kind of hair dryer I used.  I guess I always thought heat was heat.  So when I needed a new one and saw these hair dryers that were priced waaaaaay above what I was willing to spent, I really  had to see what it was about.  (After all, I could always return it I didn't find it to be any different.) But, wow. It's true, your hair dries in less time with these nicer models and by putting less heat on your hair, you're obviously doing less damage to your hair.  I used to protectant spray on my hair before drying and the difference from my old hair dryer to this was in huge.  Definitely not returning it (um, unless it breaks down the 2nd time I use it, obviously). But, I love, love this hair dryer. I am glad I decided to go for it as it was worth it."

The shadows are smooth and pigmented, even the mattes. There is a little kickup, because they're so soft, but nothing a gentle hand can't work around. I usually pat my eyeshadow on, so I don't really ahve a problem with fallout."
218881,5,"Just got it today! The 1 inch takes up a good portion of your hair.. Compare that to the one inch flat iron by babyliss.

I just purchased the same brand/formula from fragrancenet and the shampoo was amazing.  This bottle however was extremely watered down, and did not even compare to the ""minty tea tree oil"" fragrance and cool tingle of the fragrancenet version.  This smelled like cheap Prell dollar store shampoo and my sensitive scalp is broken out!  I love the real authentic shampoo, but not this stuff."

She was not able let go of the item until the fire burned through both wires and then she was able to let go. When we took her to the ER she has 2nd degree burns and blisters. We will be watching for nerve damage in the hand.
This is a horrible item that was NOT purchased through amazon but through a different vendor. We felt we needed to let everyone know this is a safety hazard. For an item to heat to 450 degrees there is no ground plug no breaker reset nothing just an ordinary flimsy plug. We  did take the item to the fire department and since there were no scortching no burns in the wall and the burns are limited to her hand and the full plug itself the fire waslimited to the device and not the house or outlet."

 I've been in love with Blinc mascara for around a year now but have fretted somewhat over how often I find myself doing the specifically 'wrong' thing: tugging the tubes off my lashes sans adequate water. I hadn't noticed my lashes thinning (as someone women seem to suffer with the mascara), but figured that a vitamin-enriched primer might not be a bad idea.

This primer substantially amplifies the length of my lashes, and I get the bonus of feeling like I am doing something nice for my eyelashes."

484545,5,"This is the best detangling leave in conditioner that I've ever used! I have super fine hair that knots ridiculously easy. A couple of sprays and I can brush right through my hair."

75764,5,"My wife loved this fragrance."
101947,5,"This works very quickly and well. This doesn't leave an oily residue or a sticky layer on the skin around your nail where the spray also hits. I love it. Much better than the aerosol I used before."
286283,5,"If you need help healing your hands this is great..if you have dry cuticles great!"

142769,5,"Excellent product, good price for the quality!"
110803,5,"This is absolutely the best tanning product I've ever seen. It is not difficult to apply evenly, and it does not have any orange-hued properties. Looks great on my ginger-haired daughter."
304128,5,"I have used this product for several years and it has made my skin clear, more firm and well protected from the daily radicals that attack our skin.  This product is the weapon that keeps on producing consistant results.  It is easy to use and it lasts in the skin for 24hrs. I tap it even on my brows and neck. The product will last several months. Both my daughters in their 30's use this wonderful and dependable product."

167574,4,"This hairspray is just ok."
12733,5,"I bought this to use for my lips.  This is wonderfully non-irritating and soothing.  I suffer from never ending dry lips in the winter and this really helps.  When applied at night, it is still there in the AM.  No fragrance and the ingredients are great.  Would recommend not just for little ones but adults too!"
120739,2,"Have tried several products including Van Der Hagen, Colonel, Conk, Proraso, Kiss My Face and several others. This item here worked pretty well in terms of creating a good rich lather rapidly and lubricating the shave. However, I would still have to give a slightly better rating to Kiss My Face which I felt lubricated the razor a little better, gave me a slightly closer shave and in my personal opinion I prefer KMF's lime scent. Price was not a factor but just adding icing. KMF was about half the price. Only knock - the name!
UPDATE: After several months I am forced to downgrade this product. Since then I have tried a few others including Trufitt & Hill, Taylor of Old Bond Street, Geo F Trumper, Spieco Shaving Stick, and Art of Shaving and each of these outperformed Jack Black in terms of glide, closeness of shave, blood spilled, and irritation. In fact Kiss My face still remains my ""go-to"" cream if I had to choose only one product. To be more clear - I have tried this again recently and now I have designated it as second to worst - worst being shaving with kosher salt."
499802,4,"I have used it for several years- it seems to stop (at least to slow) the fallout of hair"
376689,4,"I love Mustela products. Aside from the fact that their ingredients are 90% plant derived, natural and hypoallergenic, and that all their products are Paraben, Phthalate and Phenoxyethanol free, the smell is amazing! I bought this oil to give my baby his after bath massage. It is moisturizing, but it is a bit too thick; I wish it was a bit lighter and easier to spread. I mix it with a bit of coconut oil and it helps."
417413,1,"Still burned with it when out for 30 minutes"
116933,3,"This stuff is an oily cream that you use to lift other oils and oil based substances off our face.  My girlfriend said that it worked ok to remove her makeup, but neither of us particularly liked rubbing an oily cleanser on our faces in the evening."
518998,5,"I've now been using this for over a month and I'm even more impressed than those first few weeks.  Definitely worth the money."
422979,5,"Great product and fast shipping."

378537,4,"Delivered on time.  Expensive but effective.  Very happy with this product."
507819,5,"Best lotion Ive ever used. As a person whose dermatologist told me I had the driest skin shed ever seen, this lotion has actually changed the texture of my skin. It took a couple of weeks to stop the flaking, and now my skin looks 100% better. Ive tried every product on the market and this lotion is by far the best. Im a customer for life!"
238090,4,"I loved this spray! I've dealt with bacne for a long time. It has always been very difficult to use the topical creams that are normally used to treat acne because I couldn't reach my back properly. Problem solved with this product! The spray is is convenient and super easy to use and gets majority of my back area. It works very good as well. Majority of the bacne cleared up fairly quickly. I continue to use the product religiously on a daily basis to avoid further breakouts. I still get bacne but, not as bad or often and the blemishes that do show up are gone in a short period of time. I deducted one star from this review because the product smells terrible and makes me cough and gag. However, I just learned to hold my breath and spray it in a different room and walk out quickly. Try it...I think you will be pleased!"
568357,5,"Love this curling iron.  I have long hair and the extended barrel is perfect for uniform curls from root to ends."
354387,4,"My favorite sunscreen. Used Shieldo and MDSolarsciences; I thought MDSolar was better. Because it doesn't dry out my skin or make me break out (I've fallen asleep without washing the sunscreen off, my skin still looked good the next day). Application time is less than 2 minutes for me; I love this sunscreen."
142186,5,"Best facial spray. I love it!"

524603,5,"I have fine, wavy hair that is easily weighed down. This stuff is GREAT on my hair. Super volume, super style. LOVE IT. So many products weigh my hair down and make my scalp itch. Not this stuff.  I feel like I found an unbelievably great product that doesn't cost a fortune. And trust me, I will pay big $$ for products that work and so this is a double bonus. HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend."

337475,5,"Amazing scent!"

536755,5,"Illuminates and perfects, lasts all day and SPF 30-what could be better."
421876,5,"I am not good at in depth reviews but I had to say that this hair dryer saved my hair. I have super long hair (down to my lower back) and always have. I had cheap dryers in the past and didn't know what I was missing. I went from taking almost an hour to dry my hair and breaking  sweat to drying it in under 20 minutes straight out of the shower and no sweat required. My hair is healthier, shinier, and even straighter. I highly recommend investing in this dryer."
193504,5,"Order it all the time. Use it religiously once a day to control acne. Works super!"
340427,5,"Product is great.  Color safe"
466227,3,"It is a strong smell, and a lot goes a long way but it wasn't the smell I was expecting. With raspberry, rose and coconut I was going for a summery smell because of coconut that would maybe remind me of the beach and light and refreshing raspberry but I did not get any of that. I do get a sweet floral smell, it isn't overly sweet. I like the smell once it calms down after the initial spray but I it just wasn't what I was expecting after reading the description of this perfume. But it reminds me of a lot of perfumes I have smelt before it isn't a unique smell. I have tokyo milk cherry bomb and that smells just like cherries and I find it appealing. But his one just smells like an everyday perfume with no notes of rose, coconut or raspberry that I was looking forward too."
59267,5,"Best price around, can't go a day without it. Holds all day"
543400,4,"really have to scrub a lot if your lips are flaky for it to take it off, lasts a while and love the lip shimmer for after"
260061,5,"I have ordered this over and over again. It is a great moisturizer and provides medium coverage, blends well with all skin tones. I usually do not wear foundation with it as I like the coverage and get a lot of compliments on my skin while wearing it. The SPF protection of 45 is awesome! It doesn't seem to interact with other products, pill or roll. I like the original better than the matte, have tried both"
103050,5,"My weak chipping nails did get stronger after using this"
472028,3,"the colors look like they should show up but are so light,  its hard to tell the difference.  it is strange to have to use regular nail polish remover to take off 5-free nail polish."
331586,4,"This liquid lipstick is a very cute color and goes on fine.  I made sure it to put too many layers on or it does not dry fast enough and smears.  Also, it lasts a decent time like 4-5 hours without a touchup if you put a thin layer on.  It is very pigmented too so no worries about that.  One other negative is a lot of product goes on the applicator when applying so I usually have to try to scrape some off before I apply it so o don't get too much on.  Otherwise great product!"
273812,5,"I am a professional stylist and nearly every tool I have is a babyliss. I love them!"
549877,5,"Awesome product!!!"
560213,2,"I gave the product 2 stars and would have given it more if the color came out the spray can according to the label. I ordered black, and when I sprayed it on exposed scalp areas it was completely brown and now I have a mismatched head. Thanks Toppik. 0_o"
55004,5,"Thanks"
101516,3,"It's ok, but didn't seem to be able to make a dent in some of my polishes.  It says not to use a whole lot so I was wary of adding too much.  I think I would have to add a lot more than the directions say.  It worked on some of my less sticky polishes though.  Adequate result."
548087,5,"My wife has been using this product for a long time now. She finally found a product that keeps her curly frizzy hair straight, frizz free for long. And last long. My rite aid stop carrying it but thanks to amazon i was able to find it."

185600,5,"Awesome product.  My well water is highly concentrated with iron.  My color treated blonde was turning brassy....very orange.  Used this product and I could smell the rust as I scrubbed it into my hair.  I had to use 2 times to get it all out.  The only thing I don't like is that if you have a Brazilian blowout or other treatments of that type, it scrubs it out of your hair also.  I suggest planning appointments just after using so that other treatments can last."
344334,5,"Anything by Obagi is very nice.  I am 59 and have young skin because I take care of it with products like these."
24172,5,"Great product!  Just a few sprinkles on my thinning crown area and no more scalp shows through. My hair is instantly thicker looking. Can be a little messy until you get the hang of it. A little goes a long way!"
408832,5,"Love it!!"
399309,3,"Wasn't too keen on the smell, but it's not like it smelled bad. I'm sure it would be perfect for someone else who liked the scent. It came very highly rated from a friend, so I know that it's just right for some people."
464291,2,"I bought this tool and love the way it makes my hair look. The problem is the thing turns off mid use. It won't stay on to maintain a constant temp. I tried to ignore this problem but obviously something is wrong with it. I checked into returning it and I have to pay postage both ways. Ridiculous!"
32003,4,"Pretty good price - better than buying the 8 oz spray bottles all the time!"
107537,5,"I absolutely love this curling iron. It create the perfect loose curls that are nice and soft. Will definitely buy from this brand again!"
24763,4,"I like this a lot, because it has a brush, and I like the color. The only problem is it kind of leaks. Like, without twisting the pen, the gloss will already have leaked to the brush."
20345,4,"Works well when combined with another styling product on my fine hair."
121293,5,"The package is 100% safe, and there are two small packs of hair oil sample. Thanks for that! And it's arrived on time! I will be back soon. :)"
418301,5,"What an amazing tool!!! love it!! So quick, quiet and easy to use"
535048,4,"This serum makes my skin feel bouncy and soft the next day. I love how nourishing it feels when applied, yet is not greasy or too moisturizing. I have oily skin, so am easily put off by anything too emollient-feeling. This feels like a lotion and serum mixed together. Very light texture and sinks in very quickly, yet the skin feels totally moisturized and comfortable after applying.

Out of the other serums La Roche-Posay offers, I am actually more inclined to use the Effaclar Serum (which I've purchased several bottles of), simply because it is more conducive to my skin type and what I look for in skincare. I have oily, somewhat congested skin, and am 32. Although I really like this Substiane serum, I don't think that I will purchase another when I run out..it's something I think I will really love 10 years down the road. I think my mom would really like it, actually. I still use it almost daily, but concentrate it on my neck more. If you have drier skin than I, or more mature skin, you will probably love this serum.

The biggest factor that keeps me from loving this serum is the scent. It has the typical, La Roche-Posay scent which many of their products have, BUT it smells as if it's almost expired...kind of plastic-y. Another product with the same scent (that I have also gone through many tubes of) is Effaclar K--I have had similar issues with it having a plastic smell. So, I'm sure it's not every bottle, and yes--the plastic scent does fade away--but it does irritate me when I first apply it. I thought it was worth mentioning because some are very sensitive to scent."
31859,4,"great holding hairspray"
60729,5,"Been using this for a few years now.  Only need a small amount and does a great job. Smells nice and rinses out clean."

436228,5,"The best oil for hair"
260264,5,"I've used this product for years.  It not only helps to keep my lipstick brilliant longer it prevents lipstick bleeding."
571434,5,"Great exfoliant. I use it 2-3 times a week and it keeps my skin blemish free. Be careful not to keep it on too long, though, as its strong. I put it on in the shower (the steam helps activate the enzymes) and rinse it off after 3-5 minutes."
164668,5,"Love this product"
220645,5,"This blow dryer has a lot of heat.  I can only use it on medium.  It is light weight and I am hoping to have better luck with it than my last one which could catch on fire!"

224900,5,"Love this product!"
458428,5,"My hair dresser suggested this. I was skeptical -- I don't do vitamins and find them not very useful. But as I've gotten older my hair seems to be shedding excessively and thinning. She told me this would halt that, and it did. I have been using it for 2 1/2 months and I'm sold. No more wads of hair in my hands after a shampoo, just a few strands. My hair feels and looks thicker, though it's very fine to begin with so the results aren't dramatic. I just know I am losing a lot less hair. No miracles, just less hair loss!"

145307,3,"Don't love this one. The metal kind of grabs hair as you are curling it. Not smooth enough."
354508,5,"This is great. My face became consistently oily for the first time in my life following some acne treatments. I switched to this moisturizer with Simple Refreshing Face Wash Gel (also supposedly helpful for oily skin), and now I'm almost back to normal. The only thing I'm not a big fan of is the scent. It's very mild but present. I prefer unscented because of my sensitive skin. Some reviews indicated no scent and others indicated a light scent. I wasn't sure what to expect when purchased. It ended up with a light scent that I'm not entirely fond of but am used to by now. I haven't had a reaction yet so I'm hoping I will not sensitize over time."

137696,1,"My skin is to dry for this lotion."
190084,5,"My hair is soft and shiny now that I use this! I like the smell also. Sometimes I just use a small drop, and sometimes about a nickel size. I only put it on my scalp occasionally, as that will sometimes weigh my hair down."
125768,5,"Love the smell.  Love the feel."
76775,5,"I am pleased with the razor blades that I ordered.  They work well and I will order them again when needed."

402819,4,"I purchased the  iron after several months of  reading reviews and  comparing to  other products.  I  have super fine hair, but the CHI just wasn't doing what I needed it  to  do.  Ive had this  product for a few months now, and I have to say,  hands down,  its  a good product.  It heats up super fast, has a sound effect to  let you know its ready,  it  doesn't pull  my hair like the  CHI did.  I do think it may be  just a  tad too hot for  my hair  as ive noticed some breakage, but with  that I plan to  change my heat protectant."
378750,1,"The worst smell for any shampoo, let alone something that costs as much.  I had to wash my hair again to get the smell out."
345543,5,"I gave it to my daughter in law  for Christmas and she loves it."
64389,5,"Good product."
100675,5,"Really the best i have found for blondes. Even by me time in between color."
77425,5,"Very good product. Cleans well."
337795,4,"I feel like I will never be able to find the perfect mascara, but I can't complain too much with this one. It goes on pretty easily and stays on all day. Sometimes it can be a bit clumpy though, so I wouldn't call it spectacular, but it does make my lashes pretty long and thick."
34958,5,"i ordered this for our daughter who has cradle cap issues.  so far it seems to be helping.  aside from that,the smell is amazing.  i love the way it smells, and the way it leaves our daughter's hair smooth and shiny.  highly recommended."
227425,3,"I wish I looked at amazon when it had this deal before I bought it at the original(plus tax which came out to be around $50) for 1.7 oz. I'd say its worth it at $25. From using this product so far, it's actually a bit saddening, on my part. Perhaps because I really hoped that if it was double the price than my past acne medications, it would do better, right? No, in fact it's become a bit worse. I went from mild acne to a moderately distorted chin filled with red spots.
On the contrary, this product did benefit for me. The reason I switched from benzoyl peroxide to salicylic acid was because my skin reacted terribly to the point I would itch consistently- seriously. DDF acne control treatment actually seemed to smooth out my skin from excessive drying. I don't itch my face anymore nor does it get irritated when I apply it. However, I already have a moisturizer for that job. Also, I went from extreme drying peeling skin to a really oily texture that when I touch my face, for whatever reason, rather than it being smoothly baby soft, it was like waxy oily. It also leaves my face white, which doesn't bother me as I can always apply make up to cover it up or use it primarily before I sleep."
127984,2,"*UPDATE* the last bottle I purchased through Amazon was not like the previous one I loved so much. The lotion came out a greenish color and had an odd scent. After application it did not appear as dark as the previous lotion I bought either. I suspect they sold an old bottle.

Loved the color, ease of application and lack of smell. You have to use it up fairly quickly though because it's shelf life isn't too long and begins to turn."
424379,5,"Shea butter is the key.  Softness lasts well.  A bit expensive"
39664,5,"I first bought this for my wife about 10-15 years ago. I liked the smell, and the fact it is different. This is the 4th bottle I have bought for her over the years. She gets compliments from women who like the unique smell. It's probably a sweeter smell, and not for all. Somebody who likes a musky or spicy smell may not like this perfume. I however do not like spicy perfume, so this is perfect.

My opinion, a woman who thinks normal is boring and likes to enjoy the lighter side of life will probably love this perfume. Take a chance, it will either be a lifetime choice, or a one time choice, but it's worth the risk. Even if she doesn't like it, she will have a friend who would love to get it as a regift."
540244,5,"Its my favorite face wash"
277738,5,"Now that I am in my twenties, I have began using products to prevent fine lines and aging. The Stem Cellular Eye Treatment is great to reduce lines if you already have then and prevent them if you don't. Non irritating and it smells nice too! Great product with great ingredients."

272024,5,"Just writing to let everyone know how much i love this product! i'm a hairdresser and we carry this at our salon so ive been using it for about 3 months now. i highlight my hair bleach blonde about every 4 weeeks and havn't gotten a haircut in over 2 years ( i know :x ).i do a ""vial"" (keratriplex treatment) once every 3 or 4 weeks. i wash my hair about 3 times per week and ONLY use the awapuhi shampoo followed by the intensive treatment and leave it on for a few mins in the shower. ive tried the cream rinse and feel it does nothing compared to their shampoo and intensive treatment. this product is very popular and i know we have a hard time keeping these products in stock in our area. yes the price may be a little bit higher then other products but well worth the money. and p.s. if you don't want to buy the awapuhi shampoo at least get something sulfate free it makes all the difference in the world. i know i can get these products way cheaper at cosmoprof (beauty supply) but they make you buy a $100 kit in order to buy individual products. good luck finding good deals online hope this bit of info helped !!!"
20540,4,"Menscience Androceuticals was kind enough to provide a bottle for sample and review. Note that this face wash is generally most effective as part of a larger facial care kit along with a scrub, brush and lotion.

The lotion does contain salicyclic acid, so if you are sensitive to that I suggest looking elsewhere.  However you won't find a more effective face wash for managing breakouts.  Using it once every morning as part of my shower has yielded solid management and kept my skin from gettinng any bumps or breakouts.  If I stop using it, even for two days, I'll start  seeing bumps again.

The only real downside is the smell.  It's not horrible or pungent, just smells like plastic or something 'chemical' if that makes sense.  Hopefully they will consider making the formula without any sort of smell in the future, but I know sometimes it's unavoidable.

Still recommended, and again, best used with the scrub and brush."

Doesn't feel sticky or oily when rubbing on fingers (almost water consistency without water?). Unfortunately it's a new product so it was sold out at the school so I had to buy it here. It's about $10 cheaper on Amazon. I buy whatever my stylist there recommends because she really knows my hair type. Haven't tried it yet on my super curly hair to see what happens."

I was also hoping to improve skin discoloration and other signs of aging, and at first it seemed to be doing that too...but over time it seemed to become less affective for me in that area. After I finished my first bottle, I decided that maybe I needed to go up to a stronger strength. Now I'm using my second bottle, in which I changed from the 0.5 to the 1.0 hoping to improve results. Unfortunately, I'm still not getting the results that I did when I began my very first bottle. I will have to try something else for reversing signs of aging"

As other reviews mentioned, the OPI glass nail file does not rip your cuticle and is gentle yet effective. I've already noticed improvements in the growth of my nails. Working in the food industry, i'm constantly washing my hands and doing food prep, which is harsh on my nails, making he rip in the nail beds. The glass file plus sally hansen's gel color kit has done wonders in making my nails harder and grow healthier. If your looking to improve the strength of your nails, this file is the way to go."

I will say the dryer is a ""little"" heavier than a department store dryer, but not too much that I cannot use it. I have neck problems and could not use this if it were too heavy but just wanted the viewers to know this. It dries my hair very quickly without frizz or damage. BEST DRYER I have ever used and it is not as much as drug store dryers. Love it!!"

37078,5,"My baby has always had dry patches since birth, but around 3 months old, he developed full out eczema patches on his cheeks, arms, ankles and torso. Nothing I tried ever made it go away, and at best, would just stop it from getting from bad to worse. Well, one day when he was around 4 months, it got even worse. So after a lot of research, I decided to give the Stelatopia regimen a try. I eliminated all products and did the Stelatopia Cleansing Cream, Moisturizing Cream and Moisturizing Balm. Within 24 hours, I woke up to a baby with calm, smooth skin. A lot of other thick ""balms"" just sat on top of his skin, whereas the Stelatopia actually moisturized his skin and healed it. If you are struggling with baby eczema, I would highly recommend the Mustela Stelatopia line."

338815,2,"I don't know how I'm going to enjoy the 24 Karat gold color, since when I opened my package, it was not sealed and it looks like someone used it right before shipping it out to me. So I'm pretty upset. I don't have any time to return this item either and since it's an add on item, I'm not sure I could even get it replaced without spending another $25.

As for the teal color (lagoon) it arrived in a sealed plastic, like all eyeliner cosmetics should and the color is true to the picture.

It glides on easy and it's smooth. I can't wait to test how waterproof it is."

60834,5,"I have dry skin and had problems with flakiness on my chin and face area.  I have had dermatologists recommend prescriptions which were a temporary fix at best.  Elemis Cellular Recovery Skin Bliss Capsules were used when I had a facial on a cruise - the lovely little buds eliminated the problem after the first use.  While the capsules are small, there is more than enough to cover the face if used correctly - a small amount goes a long way.  This product is particularly good in cold, dry areas in the winter.  My skin has improved tremendously, to the point where someone in a restaurant commented that my skin looks ""lovely"".  It is soft and supple - I am ordering it again today through Amazon.com.  By the way, I am in my late 60's..."
209632,4,"I've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff.  When it comes down to it, it's really just shaving soap.  This stuff is no different.  Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It doesn't have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it's a good low-frills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

Overall, the soap performs great.  There's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months.  It performs as well as TOBS, but 25% less expensive."
127692,5,"Like it but over pricey"
360382,1,"It did not work for me. I did nothing to my teeth... I will not buy it again! Not effective at all!!"
161485,5,"Pros: The smell is great, it really does help absorb oil in your hair, and leaves it refreshingly good all day.

Cons: It's difficult to control the sort of puffing motion that the bottle goes through when you use it; the powder goes up in a mushroom cloud and can be difficult to manage. I might waste a lot of powder just because of that, so I've been poofing directly into  my scalp."
277214,2,"Not a fan.  Although it felt nice (I put it in the fridge for even more cooling effect just prior to use), it really did not do much for the skin around my eyes.  I did not notice any firming or plumping of the area.  The cooling gel was a little bit irritating and I needed to gently remove it a few times.  Overall, I am not a fan of this skincare line, I don't understand the hype.  I've tried some of their other products and it just seems they are made with very poor quality, low grade ingredients."
389883,5,"LOVE LOVE THIS GEL!!! IT RALLY MAKES YOUR STIFF AND DON'T USE TOO MUCH!!!! IT ALSO LEAVES A SHINE TO YOUR HAIR. PROMPT SERVICE!!"
298539,3,"I love love LRP products but I wasn't a huge fan of this. I did get the hydration I needed from it which was why I gave three stars but that's all I got out of it and I used the whole thing up to. And for the price I probably won't buy it again I can get Neutrogenas hydroboost eye cream for a lot less and get more out of it."
514364,5,"L'anza makes a great product. This is a very rich conditioner so just takes the smallest amount."
488010,5,"This product is like a combination of hair spray and cologne in one. So you're really going to have to like the scent of it or you won't like the hair spray. Even a tiny spritz of this will have you smelling like you put on cologne.

The fragrance is mildly spicy and nothing at all like the water/splash/cool/whatever scents you get with Axe or Old Spice hair products. It's different, and unlike any other scent I can think of. It has a more mature, less teenage smell to it. And the fragrance lasts. An hour later you will still catch whiffs of it.

The hairspray goes on in a broad fine mist. It has a light hold to it. It won't make your hair rock hard but will tame frizzies and smooth some. Still plenty of natural movement.

I had wondered if a hairspray could be so nice that it's worth the premium price. I think it is. This isn't your every day AquaNet, Axe, Paul Mitchell or Bed Head hair spray. This reminds me of something a barber would finish off a fresh hair cut with. A luxury hair product rather than a styling staple found in the bathroom cabinet."
42058,1,"This item seems to be a designer imposter.  It definitely does not have the same scent as a bottle I purchased at a department store.  I agree with other reviewers: BUYER BEWARE!"
308317,4,"I've only used it once. I'm writing a review early because, I've continously recieved emails asking for a review since it's been delivered & it's annoying.
Anyways, It's easy to use. I did notice a slight difference in how my skin felt, after I used it, it felt softer. I was able to see the dead skin cells that had accumulated which was assuring that it is doing it's job. The suction is not too light or too strong. I used only the training blade on my face.

I would recommend this product if you're struggling with acne &/or scarring."

38146,5,"My favorite of all time. Been using it for about 10 years."

551967,5,"Best eyeliner I've tried for water line lining. It does have to be reapplied, but not as much as any other liner that I've used. This is my second time buying this product and I couldn't be happier with it...unless it granted wishes or something."
414814,5,"This conditioner (along with the Strength Cure shampoo) makes my hair soft, strong and shiny.  My hair is quite damaged from a color removal process and recoloring (and regular coloring with permanent hair color prior to the removal process) so I was looking for a formula with serious repair properties but one that would not weigh my hair down.  After coloring, I usually do a protein treatment (Apoghee Two Step from Sally Beauty Supply is awesome, stinky, but awesome) which keeps my hair strong and in good condition.  However, it can't be done more often than every six weeks or else hair can become brittle.  I'm also really good at moisturizing my hair, using either Shea Moisture's Manuka Honey or 10 in 1 Renewal masks every week or so with a heat cap for 45 minutes or so.  However, the color removal process and subsequent recoloring takes its toll on the hair's integrity and my hair was very weak and dry, hence my search for some serious TLC.  My regular shampoo and conditioner is Living Proof's Perfect Hair Day, but it simply didn't have enough oomph for my hair's abused condition.  The LP Restore formula, which is for dry/damaged hair, is simply too heavy, weighing my hair down considerably.  So I was looking for something in the middle of these two formulas that was still sulfate free (to protect my new color).  The Pureology Strength Cure formula is just what my hair needed.  It lathers well and smells really different (which I like, although it dissipates quickly) which must mean it contains real protein.  I could tell a difference in my hair's condition the first time I used it.  After shampooing and conditioning, I used Bumble and Bumble's Invisible Oil Primer and let my hair air dry overnight.  The next morning my hair had lots of swing and body and it was really shiny (which is due in large part to the primer, which is a HG product for me).  It was almost as if I hadn't put it through all the abuse.  It still isn't the right color and I will likely have to repeat the process, but this conditioner (and shampoo) definitely made a positive difference in my hair's condition.  I purchased this product at Ulta and quite like it.  I'm sure I'll use the entire bottle and will probably buy it again.  I highly recommend it."

I like the consistency of this face wash vs the bar none face wash. This is thicker and seems to suds up better. This does not leave my face dry but neither did the bar none face wash.

I will definitely be using this face wash from now on."

468868,5,"So... I had quite the journey finding this. First tried multiple gels, axe pomade, nothing would hold my very thick hair down. I had 2 and a half inch long hair on the top and I had just recently buzzed my head to about a 2-3 last month. I really missed my long hair so I tried growing it out. After seeing multiple people and noticing it could be done with shorter hair, I started trying it myself. Gel and all these pomades weren't working very well. These people that tried it had much thinner hair and they didn't have nearly as thick hair as I did... so I turned to reddit.

I asked about the best pomade, something that could really hold my thick and close to an inch hair down: so I can comb it in a similar side-parted fashion. I received this in the mail on Tuesday, I was amazed. Though my hair isn't quite long enough to FULLY stay down, it's got another week or two left before it's there. It held it down the first bits of my hair I put this on. I do have to use quite a bit to get it to stay down, as my hair is short and very thick.. but it did the trick. And the stuff smells amazing and lasts a long time! I wake up the next morning even after washing it, and it's still in my hair a little bit. It hardens a bit, even with a little product. It's so strong yet so light when you touch it, you feel like it can come apart. And it washes out in one wash and it doesn't have my hair feeling dry or horrible and it doesn't stick to my scalp.

Thank you Reuzel! This is truly great stuff. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone in my situation."
526737,5,"Love this!"
91291,4,"""Weightless"" and ""Extra Strong"" are up for interpretation. I do have pretty think, wavy hair so...yes, it isn't sticky at all. No, it doesn't really hold the style very well. Decent regular hairspray."
82971,5,"I want to start this review by stating that unless a product significantly impresses me, I do not give out a perfect score or rating. With that being said, this is by far the best hair styling product I have ever used. I have been styling my hair with a short, spiked (messy) look for about 5 years. I have tried all different brands from Crew to Bumble & Bumble to Redken. I have experimented with pomades, gels, fibers, and wax-type holds. None have even come close to Baxter products, specifically their Clay Pomade. Yes their products are expensive, but they are without a doubt worth every penny.

Baxters Clay Pomade has a matte finish, and is also infused with natural ingredients. I have very thick, dark hair, and although it's cut short, this product holds it in place all day. I am able to style it any way I prefer, from my usual spiked up look, to a more refined combed sideways hold. Some reviewers on Amazon have stated that this product is a pain to wash out. However, if you are at all familiar with pomade/clay type hair products, then you will understand that they ALL need to be washed thoroughly out of your hair. This clay pomade is no more difficult than any others to get out.

Overall I am very pleased with my purchase! I am actually in the process of ordering an additional clay pomade as well as Baxters pocket comb and facial scrub. I would absolutely recommend Baxter of Californias Clay Pomade (2 oz.) to a friend, as its the perfect styling tool for mens hair."

Tip: DEF use toner--even just witch hazel as toner--before use, pref immediately after a warm shower to open your pores and soften your skin enough for this to rly permeate, and it sinks in SO MUCH better. Also, get some individually-wrapped cotton swabs instead of sticking your always-bacteria-laden fingers in, or the smell kinda changes over time--which... can't POSSIBLY be good, I don't think...? :) Either way, it's never done me wrong.

349552,5,"I love all the Hot Tools hair styling tools that I have purchased.  It gets very hot and is easy to use. I find that the curl holds for a long time too.  It's not too damaging since the barrel is coated but of course the high heat doesn't help.  The price is reasonable for how much use I get out of this curling iron.  I have multiple sizes of curling irons from Hot Tools and use them all the time."
330769,5,"It was as per the discription"
255588,5,"This is my go to eyeliner! Truly waterproof and love the black! It's a life changer! Can't imagine life without my Stila!"
573075,5,"My girlfriend uses this because her face is really oily. She had been using liquid make up which makes things even worse. She now uses mineral make up with this mattifying lotion and her face doesn't look glossy by the end of the work day anymore. Her skin looks normal thanks to this lotion."
178001,5,"so easy to handle and it makes your hair super straight!  I love the sleek-ness of it! I have the wider one but this one is better!"
222504,5,"The last babyliss pro I had lasted over 15 years and I am having to replace it only because I dropped it and it broke. I was not happy to replace but this straightened is amazing!!! My hair is super straight and I don't have to wash my hair every single day for it to continue to look good thanks to this straightener. Let's hope this lasts as long as the last babyliss pro!"
522524,4,"Good product"
325794,2,"After using out of this container, it doesn't hold well, I think the product is not genuine Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine. Will not buy from this supplier again.

Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine is the only hair spray I use. I've used it for years because it holds well and doesn't leave your hair sticky, brushes out easily and it smells good."
218820,3,"It's not that bad. I like the size because you can take it with you anywhere. And is good for those short hair styles that those big curling irons can't get to."
191446,1,"No Sponge comes with it.

The ""Customer Questions & Answers"" parts are misleading. The seller says that the answers for that section are not from them.

The customer services is not friendly and it is slow."
519571,5,"Love this body cream. It makes my skin super soft and the fragrance is my favorite."
290963,5,"This is the best facial sunscreen on the market.  I'm 43 with some melasma.  This sunscreen is light but powerful.  It lasts all day and keeps my melasma at bay."
200826,5,"L,Occitane is the bests"
318137,5,"Good product. Nice to apply to skin, not greasy."
269909,2,"Product itself is fine, it is the aroma that I don't like."
86064,3,"Color was fairly deep and gave full coverage after only 2 coats. When viewed in the bottle the polish appears to have a subtle, pearlescent shimmer. Unfortunately, once applied this effect was almost completely lost. I was left with plain purple nails, which was rather boring."
443407,5,"This is a nice scent for a young girl (10 yrs old.) Did not bother her sensitive skin and she loves the ""Kawaii"" bunny."
76261,3,"A little too rough on my skin. Close shave though."
214424,4,"Other than the steep price this is a great pre-shave product.  Also like the fact its in a plastic bottle makes it safer to apply in shower."
434157,5,"This was a great lot for the price and a nice way to try products before dropping a huge amount on a larger size which may or may not be worth the money."
2162,5,"Works great"
216055,5,"One of the best nail products I have ever used.  Quality and long lasting without chipping! Excellent and would recommend to friends and family!  Love it!"
136291,5,"Classic neutral color and I like the butter brand because it's less toxic than other nail polish brands. It dries with a high gloss and lasts several days."
99060,5,"This goes on clear, and is very creamy feeling.  Love the protection it offers. This is my favorite brand to use."
360678,5,"This is the best makeup remover and facial cleanser! Leaves skin clean and soft."
67452,5,"I love this stuff. My hairdresser recommended it and I have been using it ever since. My hair is so much softer and healthier looking. After having mouse fur chemo hair for the past couple of years, this is a welcome relief!"
379193,1,"Not universal. It does not fit my Babyliss dryer."
351944,5,"Best dry shampoo out there. Great scent and really takes the grease out. Rubs in well and doesn't leave white residue on my dark hair."
494438,5,"This is a great way to ensure you can pack up your essentials that might leak, while keeping them away from your clothing.  Enough room for razor, shaving cream, shampoo, toothpaste, conditioner and soap--all you need for the hotel bathroom!

This is a very sturdy case that appears to be made very well with two zippers.  It's really a unisex look so it can be used by a man or a woman; the yellow stripe adds a bit of flair.

Nice microwave and water resistant material, it's also thin enough so that it can be compressed in your luggage when there is not much in it in order to take up little room

A handy strap on the top makes it easy to tote.  Nicely designed and works well.

Review is my unbiased opinion"
8822,5,"Love the product!"
236098,2,"Glytone Mild gel wash wasn't what I expected. Although it is dermatologist recommended, I was totally disappointed. The face wash leaves my skin feeling irritated and totally dry. If I am broken out, the cleanser stings my skin. After drying my face I am left with a residue feeling on my face- kind of a filmy feeling.
This was supposed to be a great cleanser but I will never use it again!"
126641,3,"It's a fine cream but I needed a stronger product"
99556,5,"This cleanser has been a huge help when getting rid of acne and helping to fade my acne scars. I highy recommend it for people with scarring and acne. I use it three time out of the week at night and im still seeing improvement."
93920,4,"As a person who suffers from a lifetime of cystic acne, this product is wonderful. No miracle over night cure but with time it works,"
387312,4,"Was hoping that it would make my lashes a bit darker.  BUT, the length is great!!!!"
10973,5,"I have been using this product for years --- before my love began with Amazon shopping ---- if I would have to be without it I would be extremely upset, the stuff is a lifesaver for thin spots of hair."
448143,5,"I love the texture of the serum- it is light and absorbs easily into my combination skin. It provides great protection and doesn't feel tacky or oily on my face and neck. The finish is very natural, and I find that it works well under makeup, provided that you don't use a silicone oil-heavy foundation (which might end up sliding around on your face). It's very expensive for the amount, but I like the hygienic pump bottle, light moisture, and most importantly, the high and reliable sun protection that this sunscreen serum provides."
124530,5,"I grabbed this up and didn't realize it was for men.  I really like the cream anyway - it is rich, smooth, and super nice for sensitive skin.  I like that the cream is really thick.  One tube should last me a long time."
85148,5,"Great neutral color!  I'd have to call the color 'clay.'"
280086,5,"Great product at a great price"
375899,5,"Perfect for touch ups when you don't want to get a manicure every day for 10$, even better for those with real nails"
535930,1,"The gel was hardened when received so when brushed into your eyebrows it clumps"
475586,5,"Liked it and and bought a 2nd one for family member"
573316,5,"Good. Arrived on time as promised."
387115,4,"I purchased it because I started losing some of my eyelashes and had a little bald spot. It worked for me, saw the difference within days. I don't use every night because I get lazy but it has helped me regrowing them and they are longer too"
476234,2,"Battery goes bad and is not replaceable.  Clarisonic will only replace it for the warranty period, after that it has to be thrown away.  Mine died in less than two years."
36501,5,"I bought this for traveling overseas. Works really well. I like it so much, I'm using it a lot at home after I came back. I definitely recommend it."
33485,4,"It's good stuff, no doubt, but a bit expensive to warrant 5 stars. One tube lasts a couple of months. Their shaving soap is good, too."
207822,5,"Love it. Acne goodbye forever"
483715,5,"Gorgeous color!"
453528,5,"Much Love it"
50444,5,"I received this perfume for Christmas one year and since then I have worn nothing but this.  It has a very unique scent, its not too sweet or over powering."
539965,3,"The top cap of this keeps smearing black specks on my fingers!!! Manufacturer needs to fix that issue.  But shipped promptly by vendor."
573353,5,"this is the best lotion i have ever used. my hands are usually cracked and bleeding in the winter..but not any more....the only thing i like the least is the price...but with results like this i will adjust"
254579,5,"The best liquid eyeliner by far. Stays on all day with no smearing or running. The fine tip makes it incredibly easy to apply a thin or thick line on upper and/or lower lids."
422510,5,"Excellent product. Have been using for years."
176935,3,"Meh. Dont buy at full price! I have used a revlon one (super cheap) for yearsssss on my long hair and decided to ""upgrade"" to this one. Honestly, this one works way worse. Disappointed. No clue why everyone loves this brand."
210663,5,"Nothing"
277577,5,"This is the best product I have found to help with a dry scalp in the winter."
100397,5,"love the price , I think this was a great bargain!!"
335676,4,"I really like this hair treatment! Leaves my hair feeling soft and frizz free! And i love how it smells!"
329655,5,"It was recommended by my Dermatologist"
212919,4,"lightweight, slightly pulls hair while ironing, but since it is thin and small, great or straightening from the roots and shorter hair"
496006,5,"Best dryer ever ,does not hurt your hair at all . Highly recommended"
336847,5,"Excellent shave cream. One of the best I have ever tried. I will definitely continue using it. Great lather, smooth application, and I don't have any issues with razor burn or irritation with it."
542346,5,"I loved this candle which I gave to my wife for Christmas. The scent was not overpowering and the charm inside was a second gift my wife added to her charm bracelet..the best thing was the kind, patient customer service person who helped me with the purchase. I definitely am looking to purchase another candle."
469755,5,"Boxed beautifully hope it's the real deal"
515576,5,"Great product"
458267,4,"I'm happy with this purchase."
230452,3,"It's okay... I was looking for an alternative to DIY Fiberwig mascara, but didn't compare that well. OK but not great. Its tube mascara so for me its always going to be better than the alternatives. However its - for me - by far not the best tube mascara I've found. I do prefer my mascara quite dry and not too blobby and I found this - in comparison to my usual Fiberwig - wet and rather messy.

179501,3,"This is the 3rd time I have purchased this exact item. Why? A couple of reasons, it gets as hot as you need it to get, and flattens the hair as straight as you can possibly get it! A couple of caveats tho: the outside of the iron also heats up, a hot iron glove is an ABSOLUTE necessity, and at this price, should be included when buying the iron. Also, overtime, the plates tend to loosen and the outside of the plates began to discolor. The iron lasts maybe a year, depending on usage, and I use it at least 5 days out of the week."
253730,2,"I loved the color but after I used it about five times, the eyeliner tip rubbed out and I can no longer apply the eyeliner."
565019,5,"Love this product! Really helps lipstick and gloss to stay last longer."
541228,5,"Product lives up to its marketing message."
203808,5,"It's Proraso, which is a standard and should be in everyone's collection. This is extremely easy to lather as it's in between a cream and a hard soap. The smell is fine, is strong enough during the shave. This product gives the characteristic tingle while using which is quite pleasant. I have sensitive skin on my face and I've experienced no issues using this product (use 1 year)."
131840,5,"A+++"
88754,3,"It smells nice, but after time I do not notice that my hair is more ""thick"" I infact notice the same amount of hair in my drain as before"
370584,5,"Goes on even and I have no idea how this line of polish works, but I can get a good 10 days worth of wear without chipping or peeling. Much safer on the nails than gel polish.  Comes off easily with nail polish remover!"
216562,5,"This is a great  product.  My skin is in great shape and I've been using it for a year and a half (I'm 55).  It works well with the Retinol A Complex as well (used 2 - 3 times a week).  The best place I have found to by it is on the website SkincareRx.com.  I verified that it was an authorized dealer and they always have sales and great deals on the SkinMedica products (amongst others).  It's a bit pricey, but well worth it."
140719,5,"Best stuff....def keeps my face clear from blemishes."
9886,1,"It does get warm, but it only pushes my lashes up, which doesn't curl them!  I would like to return it."
311943,5,"Works beautifully! I found it gave me an even tan and protected my hands from coming into contact with the tanner. Very easy to use and good quality."
200988,4,"Great hand cream.  Works well for soaps that suck all moisture out of your hands and leave dry cracked 'ashy' skin.  However, this is heavily fragranced.  My wife and daughter sneeze quite bit after I use this.  If it were only lightly or not fragranced this would be the best."
395028,1,"One thing lasted me ONE leg. That's it. Does anyone know where i can get a better quality cartridge that is either cheaper or lasts longer?"
6541,5,"Awesome quality that I would expect from OPI."
74738,5,"I am a man with a lot of hair but very thin and hard to hold.  this shampoo has given my hair great body and texture.  you can feel the difference in your hair after you use it.  it feels as if it has gained more volume and weight.  great product... the thick shampoo is great as well!  i am using both."
479021,5,"It works perfect for baby acne just 1 week and no more acne on my princess"
489174,2,"I'm so disappointed. Obagi have reformulated 360 Exfoliating Cleanser. It used to contain lots of small gritty beads, it truly was a wonder product. I'm sorry but this version is terrible in comparison to the old formulation. Obagi, please change it back."
143660,5,"Ive been through a dozen curling irons, and this is The One.  I literally get stopped by passers by to ask how I get my hair to look the way it does.  Heats quickly, curls last all day, no damage."
57710,5,"I really enjoy this scent! It smells very nice on me. I pass up my Juicy Noir just to wear this :)"
67213,4,"Leaves my hair feeling clean, and smells a bit like mint/tea tree oil. My hair has no residue/heavy feeling, and has never felt oily after use. Previous reviewers stating their hair felt greasy after must not have followed instructions, or rinsed properly. I've only used for 3-4 months, so I'm not sure yet if it'll halt further hair loss, or regenerate hair."
194708,5,"This is a great light lotion for sensitive skin"
16761,4,"this 2 inch does not really curl or even wave long hair... it just gives it a nice polished look that is curled in at the ends."
345609,1,"stopped rotating in few uses"
279852,5,"This works, I am an adult and I have breakouts. This gets rid of them. Buy it you'll love it."
61045,5,"I know this product is for cellulite but my mother actually stumbled on to the fact that this stuff was magic in a bottle, now everyone in my family has a bottle in their medicine cabinet. I can't speak to the cellulite ridding properties of this oil, but I can tell you that it is great for aches and pains. My favorite use for this little beauty is my migraines. The minute my head starts hurting I just massage some of this oil on my neck and temples and sit back and let it do it's stuff. No more aches for us!"
127143,5,"seems to tighten and firm skin on the neckline very satisfied with this product you can really see the results of nectifirm"
40249,5,"Love this perfume! I have been wearing it for years and I am very happy I found it for a good price!"
35960,5,"I LOVE these pads and help greatly when used with skin lightening products to remove and lighten dark spots. I highly recommend this if you have dark spots!"
132149,5,"I could not exist without this!!!! I love that it covers very thin spots and it also adds thickness with the fibers. I love this product!"
210000,5,"OK IF YOU HATE SHAVING?!?! Get this , then go to YouTube look up how to use shaving soap. Watch several videos. Then break out your soap/cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try! If you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet.

I hated shaving! My skin always got irritated and burned after! Then I tried this stuff after watching hours of videos, I broke down and gave it a whack. Now mind you I'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and I get worn out in my chair quickly!!!! After using this I look forward to shaving I can't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause I'm going to shave... I will spend the extra 10 min to get outta  bed to go through the procedure to shave ! My skin comes out so smooth and irritation free!!!!!! And the girlfriend really noticed a difference! Spend the money, spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting !!!"
46291,1,"I don't like this dryer at all.  To heavy and powerful, when you're done blowing your hair you have hair knots all over and you end up combing the knots out; which takes you longer doing your hair.  I don't recommend this product at all."
385481,5,"Made the right choice after deciding on whether to replace a bottle of another cologne with Burberry Brit Rhythm. I've had other Burberry colognes, which were ""so-so"", but this one is a great fit for my preference of day-to-day business use."
67510,5,"This is a favorite that I use almost daily. Excellent service & price."
182476,5,"Best product ever, miracle in a bottle"
521784,5,"This is a beautiful fragrance -- just love it -- fills the whole room with the yummiest aroma.

Long lasting and burns to the last drop."
243240,3,"It lasts about a week.  But I do have to put an additional topcoat on at least once during the week."
335387,5,"This stuff is amazing!! My hair has never been more smooth, shiny, and healthy!"
44726,3,"For the most part this iron is great. The only issue I have with it is it does not glide as smoothly through my hair as my last Babyliss flat iron. It does pull at the hair a little. It's a great iron for the price."
294741,4,"Wonderful stuff. It came quickly."
52107,5,"Love this cleanser, it leaves my skin squeaky clean without any irritation. I also like the texture, it's soft and creamy. I would buy again as I have sensitive skin and this cleanser is gentle."
159987,5,"Great for firming skin"
342853,5,"always like Musgo Real , hadn't tried the orange , a pleasant surprise"
542744,5,"It's my favorite!"
276494,3,"Jury is still out on this. I have been using it for apx 4 months and don't see any difference in my skin. I am fair skinned and  have a clear complexion therefore maybe this is way I'm not seeing a difference. Not sure I would order again. Also if you use just a wee bit more than you should it tends to be sticky and my foundations doesn't settle as well. So now I am only using it at night."
290519,3,"Okay but I found the tint too tan"
68310,5,"I love this product . It is the same product I buy local for a much better price"
405073,1,"NOT AS DESCRIBED....JUST A SWEET ALCOHOL SMELL.  THE BOTTLE IS GORGEOUS BUT I CAN'T STAND THE SMELL SO IT IS JUST SITTING ON DRESSER."
559346,5,"This cream is a dream in my very thick, uncontrollable hair.  This product brings it in check.  It's not greasy at all once I've brushed it in."
378799,5,"Great Cologne, smells fresh and clean. Perfect scent for the summer."
1915,3,"I have just used up my first jar of Calm Cool & Corrected which lasted about 2 months using it sparingly morning and night.  I have rosacea and peri-oral dermatitis with severe peeling and redness.  This product was very soothing and definitely helped the redness.  It also did not cause any acne breakouts.  I was disappointed, however, in the moisturizing effect of this product.  It isn't very hydrating and didn't help the severe peeling in my T-zone. If the product helped the dryness and peeling along with it's positive effect on the redness, I would probably try another jar.  However, I just can't bring myself to get hooked on a product that's going to cost me $500 plus a year to use."
461068,5,"This stuff lasts with no chipping and my nails never looked better! Wish it had the glossy top coat, but I ordered that separately, so all good!"
267955,4,"I love theses disc and they are the perfectly compliment to the PMD system. I try to use the system once a week on my face and I don't always get to the rest of my body. So, I especially appreciate the fact that you get 4 face and 2 body in this set. The other set of 3 and 3 just left me with too many body ones in the end."
143518,2,"They changed the formula majorly since all of these awesome reviews. Before the ingredients were:

Deionized Water (Aqua),Aloe (Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice) Vera Gel,Bladderwrack (Fucus Vesiculous) Extract,Herbal Extract,Rose (Rosa Gallica) Extract,Gardenia (Gardenis Florida) Extract,Propylene Glycol.

The new ingredients are:
Aqua (Water,Eau),Propylene Glycol,Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice,Rosa Canina Extract,Thymus Vulgaris (Thyme) Leaf Extract,Fucus Vesiculosus Extract,Gardenia Florida Fruit Extract,Caprylyl Glycol,Hexylene Glycol,Polysorbate 20,Parfum (Fragrance),Phenoxyethanol,Sodium Chloride,Citronellol,Geraniol,CI 17200 (Red 33),CI 42090 (Blue 1)

They've added way more of the glycols, propylene glycol used to be the last ingredient and now it's second, which is room for concern (glycols are alcohols and alcohols are drying), and now ethanol is in it (an even worse alcohol). Ethanol makes products quickly dry which makes them feel weightless on the skin for cheap... HOWEVER, ethanol causes irritation to the skin and is bad for ALL skin types, which you will see if you buy this product. Just do a google search and see for yourself. Some alcohols are okay, but not ethanol! I have very clear skin and never have bad breakouts. My skin is not sensitive and I really never worry about using anything on it because it's just rarely an issue. The day after I used this I had a terrible breakout, worse than any other skin product ever has. I'm really disappointed and wish I could get my hands on the old formula that everyone loved so much."
42131,5,"This is one of my all-time favorite scents! This perfume isn't comparible to anything - finally a totally unique scent!"
349632,5,"This is probably one of my favorite purchases that I've made for myself in the past year. I have thick, slightly wavy hair that's unpredictable in the morning. I've been looking for a larger barrel that can give me that professional blow out look, but that won't take me hours to take. After some trial and error, I've really mastered loose and large curls in under 10 minutes after heating. The directions of heat settings are accurate (per the included instructions). I've owned several Hot Tools items. They have yet to disappoint. How are these items so inexpensive too?!"
171985,5,"Item shipped same day and got here quickly. I
I am very happy with this cream. I feel like
it's puffed up my under eye area so it's filled
in and not showing the fine lines. My forehead
also looks much better. I saw immediate results
and am also beginning to see longer term effects.
The product is great and I will def buy it again!"
55690,4,"The perfume is awesome,great top notes bursting with a citrus sunny smell that blows ppl away and the following notes are rich with sultry scents,the perfume has also a great staying power with my skin so I get eight hours before it fades away"
171844,5,"it's a great brush - that's all I will use - would recommend it to anyone!  It met my expectations."
308259,4,"good"
125501,5,"This stuff is great used it for years now!"
462267,1,"It doesn't do what it claims, no fibers that I can see to make lashes longer"
327238,5,"Great stuff!!!"
364248,5,"I ordered this because Shemar Moore said he liked to wear it. Well it was so similar to ANGEL by Thierry Mugler that I was pleased."
445084,1,"I guess you need to use the entire bottle to before you see any changes. I won't buy it again"
83913,2,"I love the way it smells but it was never delivered."
233307,5,"Great shopping experience from the time I placed the order to the time I received the item.  It was ery easy to place the order and it arrived in the expected time frame."
197381,5,"I live in Fl and get a lot of sun exposure.  This is a great moisturizer. It is also a very good price."
125803,5,"very smooth but the smell is just meh ""ok"", it doesn't smell bad so its an A+ in my books."
566780,5,"Its great!"
79693,1,"I followed the instructions very thoroughly, but it did not work! It damaged my hair so bad that my ends are fried! I have to get over an inch of my hair cut off for it to look somewhat decent. It took a little bit of the frizz out of my hair, but didn't take any curl out whatsoever! I would suggest using a product that actually works, or going to the salon and getting it done. It is not worth the hair damage to try this product!!"
503926,5,"nice brush. i got one from my salon for double the price. This is a great price"
313598,5,"Easy to use and storage.
Gives a good result from the first time"
308445,5,"I was a bit intimidated at first with this product with all the warnings and a video of how to use it. After watching the video, it was a breeze to work with. My skin has been a little rough this summer and I've only used this twice and already see great improvement."
546422,5,"Perfect for short hair on a windy day :)"
44043,5,"Great product!  I am glad that I ordered this product."
14481,5,"Love this product! Looks natural & last all day.  I've been using it for years. Cupid's breathe is my favorite color"
50028,3,"I have been using The Balm Time Balm for about 4 years. Finding a good concealer that doesn't cake up has alway been a problem for me until I gave this a go. It's really smooth, moisturizing and blends well. I've always gone to Sephora to pick it up but the one in my Mall stopped carrying it. I ordered the two shades I always wear (one for winter & spring when I'm a bit pale and one for summer & fall when I've got more color). I was VERY surprised that both were not the same as the shades I currently have. The mid medium is DARK! At least 2-3 shades darker than I can wear.
This is one of the main reasons I don't like ordering from the internet but I figured since I already have the product and use it there wouldn't be a gamble. Guess I was wrong. Disappointing."
285314,4,"I absolutely love this stuff. I don't have time to get to mall and can get this in 2 days"
185775,3,"For those who have color treated or fine hair like mine I would suggest using a rich conditioner after use. I couldn't use the shampoo and conditioner daily, more like a few times a week. It left my hair too dry. The packets were useful, I would use them every two weeks."
517195,2,"This is tiny piece of soap, hotel size 3x2 and NOT 6 x 5 x 4 inches as mentioned on the product description, which makes it overly expensive."
373939,5,"I love this product. It great on my natural curly hair."
106633,4,"With this applicator you are putting the powder on the right spot were it is needed, I think it is worst ordering with your product. I'm glad I did."
502889,5,"I had purchased tea light candles in the Havana scent from a local store and fell in love with them. I have also given this brand of candles in different scents as gifts.  The diffuser scent covers a large area, is convenient, lasts a long time because of the large volume, and everyone that visits comments on the yummy scent in my home.  Havana is a masculine scent....think Benico del Toro or Javier Bardem....but all of the ""flavors"" of Archipelago are great."
404830,5,"I absolutely love this lotion. It really makes my legs feel so much better after a long day at work.  I wish it came in a bigger bottle. I would buy it by the gallon if I could!"
192864,5,"After using the spray applicator I can say for sure that I will always be using it going forward. It almost make the keratin more of a air brush and you have much more control. It also makes it less likely to bunch up. There is a noticeable difference in spray quality and stream once you are about half way down the bottle.

If you are looking for more control and to specifically control your hair line, this is a must own."
560440,5,"I love this scrub so much that I bought it as a gift for my sister. I use it once a week and it really smooths my skin without irritating or drying it out."
392337,5,"Love this product! Thick on the brush and therefore easy to paint on the face. Great scent that lasts into the day too!"
369074,5,"I brought this as a gift and it has been great so far. She uses it almost daily and hasn't had any trouble."
317533,2,"Did not stand up to the La Roche Posay reputation and did nothing for my skin."
304882,2,"This product caused my skin to breakout and I normally do not have acne at almost 40yrs. old. It could be from the dimethicone. Waste of money"
193336,1,"The item is broken when I received it, so sad about it. It never happen to me before"
292588,1,"It has a defective spray cap. Takes two hands to push down hard on the counter. A waste of money! Can't use it."
448676,4,"The rollers are too large for my hair. It takes a little long for rollers to get hot. Otherwise, a great product!"
137936,2,"This product arrived unsealed.  Looked as if it had been used.  I contacted the seller: Authentic Skin Care.  They would not respond until I contacted Amazon customer service to complain.  I had a bad reaction to the product and Authentic Skin Care refused to stand behind the product.  I also indicated that I had received this item unsealed.  Authentic Skin Care finally relented and said I could return the item at my expense and they would charge me a restocking fee.  Authentic Skin Care made this experience a huge disappointment.  Many of my friends purchase on Amazon, so I decided to give it a try.  I doubt I will be making future purchases on Amazon.  It apparently is a huge risk to purchase items on Amazon"
43316,5,"This is a new brand name for me, but so far I'm very impressed!  My skin looks great, & for those of us with sensitive skin its great."
500604,1,"Burned my face. I don't even have especially sensitive skin."
60299,5,"This is a wonderful product  I have used it for several years and it does cause your hair to grow back. I was experiecing hair loss because of being a diabetic"
344275,5,"Derm recommended"
29462,5,"Love this color! It's my color of this summer. I also really appreciate the fact it doesn't have all of the harsh and harmful chemicals common in most all nail polishes. Will order more colors!"
66392,1,"Not a huge fan of this concealer. Felt sticky!"
340227,5,"This hairspray is the best thing I 've found to hold both my straight limp hair and my husband's curly thick hair.  Gives me volume where I need I. Gives him the control he has to have. Now we don't need several different products for each of us, just one for us to share."
489886,2,"Didnt see much difference in my skin while using this. Brought it on recommendation from a friend, and was not totally worth the money."
196599,2,"I had very high hopes for this organic cleanser but was kind of disappointed it didn't work for my oily acne prone skin. I struggle with a few hormonal cystic breakouts around that time of the month and some pimples here and there. My skin routine i was doing at the time worked for me for like a year in a half and then all of sudden my skin started to break out and I knew I needed to find an acne kit. I was trying to not use anything to harsh on my face so I thought I'd try the organic route. I red a couple positive reviews on juice beauty so I went to my local ulta and pick this up for $39.00. I knew that when you start a new skin routine your skin may break out a little because all the dirt and oil's being pulled to the surface and then It should start getting better. I used the whole kit twice a day like it says. This worked the 1st couple of times i used then my skin started to become more oily and I started to get a few cystic bumps nooooo nightmare! I stopped using this on my oily acne skin bought clean and clear advantage and have almost fully cleared my acne thank god! I gave this cleanser to my boyfriend and it works amazing for his normal skin type not fair! The organic route just didn't work for my skin type. Would recommend the juice beauty vitamin c serum though!"
355044,5,"Love this line of products - love them soooo much."
356151,5,"Great product. Leaves my hair soft. Don't need a lot of it for it to work. Way better than salon product's."
78440,4,"Very good shampoo. My hair likes it. A bit pricey."
398173,1,"Does not work well with shoulder length hair.  Got mine tangled up and lost massive amounts of hair."
278288,5,"The best I've tried"
225567,5,"The ONLY ... I repeat... ONLY product to withstand Mismi heat! My hair frizzes st the slightest sign of moisture and I feel likeI never have to mess with my hair when wearing this product. Im constantly checking to make sure it stays perfectly straight and smoothe the entire day/night and it has not let me down in even the most humid of days! Pricey but worth the buy! Wow is all I have to say!"
66520,5,"I tried this as a lid primer and for myself, really did not like it that much, but I think I got the idea from another reviewer about using this as an under eye  concealer and I have been doing that and absolutely love it as an under eye concealer!  I put the Jane Iredale Lid Primer under my eyes after my moisturizer and then cover it with Jane Iredale Glow Time Full Coverage Mineral BB Cream makeup.  The lid primer serves to deflect light away from my under eye shadows and improves the appearance of my 55+ year old eye area."
138700,2,"Received correct brush, but ordered black,but received a bright RED one.
No notice that another color would be automatically substituted until received. The invoice stated it could be one of several colors, but not stated before ordering.
My husband has used this brush for many years, but did not want a RED brush."
459347,5,"I ordered both the gold and silver polish,  exactly what I wanted.  The first one that arrived was not packed nor secure and was loosely dropped down inside of a larger box of an item that I had ordered separately.  I guess I'm lucky it didn't break.  Will order both again but I won't order it with anything else at the same time so the polish can't be dropped down inside a larger box to get knocked about in transit.  The second nail polish arrived a few days later packed by itself as both should have been.  Even tho the one rolled around at the bottom of the box it arrived intact.  So, alls well that ends well....this time."
389483,5,"If you're looking for a HARD hold and a shiny look, this is the gel for you! I've been using this product for several years and I wouldn't trade it for anything else. It has a very good sent and it stay on ALL day even after sweating and the good thing is that it does NOT flake. Taking it off is simple, just rinse head with lukewarm water and shampoo hair gently and it'll come off easily. Definitely 5 STARS!"
477419,5,"Im in my mid-thirties and have recently been making a conscious effort to start a good skin regimen. For me, that means fewer, nicer quality products and definitely none of the scrubs or brushes I used to use. Having gotten used to Luna by Foreo, I cant believe I used to inflict so much harshness on my skin - this definitely feels more gentle, much kinder and just better."
260797,4,"Great blowdryer,  awesome results!  Left my hair smooth and silky in half the time.  Couldn't believe the power it had.  My favorite ever,  by far!  It is on the heavier side,  but nothing I won't adjust to.  The results make it worth it alone."
261443,3,"I think this would be great if it fit my blowdryer. I wish it was universal. I think the new luxe 2i is even better then the old featherweight. This attachment just isn't for it"
269997,4,"Just recommended by beautician to try."
323496,2,"Didn't see any difference to my dry hair."
44233,5,"Is perfect the best .I recommended '"
441416,4,"Just turned 50, look early 40s. I was surprised that this did provide immediate results - they're subtle but noticeable. My skin looked a bit brighter, my jaw line a bit firmer, and my eyebrow area a bit more taught.  The feeling is a bit tingly, definitely felt a bit of a charge, but not painful. I will continue to update as I see results and will add a star if its warranted."
330079,5,"Beautiful color."
233865,5,"good product"
429089,4,"There is a lot to like about this clarifying solution. It does seem to do a nice job of reducing breakouts on my face. Breakouts have been a chronic problem for my sensitive skin. Since I have been using this product, acne is noticeably reduced and my skin becomes smoother and nicer looking as well. Also, it doesn't seem to dry out my skin as much as other toners that I have tried before.

I like it enough that it has now become part of my daily facial regimen. It goes pretty well with my regular facial cleanser. Overall, this product works as advertised and the price is reasonable."
221946,5,"Works great! Thank you!"
91307,5,"Nice scent. Make sure you press the sprayer correctly/firmly so that it MISTS onto your hair instead of the stream. No problem! It is also an option to spray into your hand and spread it through your ends. :) xoxo"
238587,4,"I cannot peel it off, but it does make it easier to remove the sparkles! Good product"
315677,5,"my favorite beauty product by far. The pigment is beautiful"
174038,5,"Works really well. For oily skin use alone. Spray on before and after makeup! Boost of hydration. Love it!"
309951,5,"One of the best mineral foundations I have used. It is light, yet gives great coverage. If you want even fuller coverage, apply one layer, wait a few minutes, and then go in an apply another layer. It's very buildable and does not get cakey unless you REEAALLY pack it on. Didn't break me out so it is great for sensitive skin!! I have veeery fair skin, and the porcelain matched my neck but the color 'light' was a true fit to my face tone color. Doesn't run orange or oxidize. Highly recommend and is a decent price for a higher end product!"
226926,5,"This is a very good product for dry, itchy skin. Perfect for winter!"
258588,2,"Makes my hair feel sticky!"
507781,1,"is the second time I bought this product, the first time came with plastic around, sealed! this time the product came without protection looks like it was used, I received the product open"
458092,5,"Very good"
226775,5,"Love the texture and the fragrance is awesome"
225183,5,"Great product"
357727,5,"Smells like cupcakes and makes your hair super soft!"
345057,5,"a gift for friend only"
511464,3,"This serum looks and feels like a moisturizer so you can't tell if it's supposed to be working wonder for your face and worth the price.  It seems to be an expensive bottle of moisturizer."
565792,5,"Works wonders on hair. Doesnt leave a lot of heaviness, its not super light as suggesting in description but for a detangles and leave in to work they have to have certain oils and emollients to coat hair shaft to provide a slickness to achieve this otherwise its basically water to comb hair until dry and your back at beginning later in day with issues of static, frizz and tangled etc. if you have damage this will help a lot with moisture. Which then helps with the frizz and tangles. If on healthy hair which I use it on Kids its excellent they often have endless tangles and its very hard to brush even using conditioner in shower. They have long long hair and this not only allows for a easy brushing but no crying. It lasts most the day using very little. I recommend spray hands and rub on hair vs spritz, bc it is thick solution that basically squirts 1 spot of head vs sprays hair."
35247,5,"Recommended by a Professional Hairdresser. Does an excellent job; lots of power and light weight. Have one in each bathroom."
467351,5,"Great product! I have no sun spots on my face since I started using this product"
42393,5,"I love the lather and the scent."
556971,5,"This product works great! And the price is totally worth it! Because the powder does not come out through the brush, I just loosen the lid on the bottom carefully and pour some into a separate container. I use it several times a day all over my face. I bought one in August and it has lasted me an entire year."
479632,5,"Lotion is dark in color and doesn't seem to streak at all when applied."
45363,4,"The best"
357064,5,"This dries my hair very very quickly!  Which is what I bought it for. And it's very lightweight. Be aware though, it's a professional model, so it has a very long cord."
456651,3,"Wanted to love this product but it just didn't give me much color.  The scent is really nice and it makes my skin feel really smooth, but my white Irish legs are still pretty white.  I didn't expect it to turn me into Malibu Barbie, but a couple shades darker would have been nice."
297345,1,"This is not an authorized seller of Paul Mitchell products and if anything goes wrong the warranty is not fulfilled by Paul Mitchell. I purchased the XL Curiling iron last year and aftr 6 months the ionic coating began to wear off of the barrel of the curling iron. I contacted the seller of this item on numerous occassions to get no response. I then contacted Paul Mitchell to be informed they only provide the warranty if the item is sold be an approved Paul Mitchell Salon.
I thought I would save a few dollars buying this item online but know see that purchasing the item from my salon would have saved me the hassel and frustration."
105575,4,"Love this fragrance although it seems a little more sharp than my old one that I bought at the Crabtree & Evelyn store.  Wondering if maybe the one I ordered was a little old.  However, it's still great!  Thanks!"
324032,5,"I bought this back in early November.  About a week and a half ago the first one (Teak Wood) finally reduced to the size where is was difficult to use directly (not on a brush, for instance).  So I've brought out the Cedarwood Marine, and it's also scented well.  But considering I got ~2 months of use from one bar, this is outstanding and smells great to boot!  Definitely recommend.

Each bar comes individually wrapped in shrinkwrap.  I separated them into my different drawers to keep the contents smelling good!"
399918,5,"the crabtree items were a gift and she was very happy with them."
154845,5,"great product - smells so good."
24355,5,"Toothpaste that leave your mouth tasting and smelling like flowers??? Yes please!  I love this toothpaste!"
249066,5,"Product is light, add shine and does not weigh the hair down.  I will order this product again. I really love it."
234448,5,"I really like this shaving brush. The bristles are soft and easy to use on my face. Its also very easy to clean"
131640,2,"I purchased this from a beauty supply place before and this doesn't seem like the same quality. Disappointed"
77194,5,"Enjoy luxury from the world of shaving as art.  Old fashion wet brush application feels clean and fresh.  The lather rinses clean.  Sandalwood fragrance is addictive!!  Indulge yourself . . ."
373575,5,"Worked just as advertised.  My polish stays on so much longer with this top coat. It also keeps my toenail polish from fubbing off when I wear shoes."
135627,1,"Got this item the other day and it was not tinted at all. The color is that of the original sunscreen (pale yellow). Luckily, I love using the original sunscreen but had wanted to try the bronze tint for something different during the dreary winter time. It'd be nice, as a long time customer of Amazon, that MD Skin Solution try to make things right with the wrong item sent, but I don't know what they'll do...."
157858,4,"I used Juice Beauty's Tinted Moisturizer for the first time a long time ago and I remember that it used to come on matte. I decided to give it a try again recently and now it comes on differently as I remembered -- it's very shiny. I'm Asian and have olive-based, medium skin tone. The color is a nice neutral shade -- not too yellow, not too pink -- and the coverage is pretty thick (almost like a BB). Even though I'm not a fan of the thick feel and shiny application, I like that it doesn't use bad ingredients and I've never had a break out when using it (I have combination to oily skin).

Also, I recently went on vacation to Thailand. The SPF was good enough to protect my skin for the sunny conditions."
420857,5,"if you want to do something good for yourself and want luxury pure you got to have the DAO foaming Shower Gel, it is a little expensive but for me worth it,"
394812,5,"Best nail clipper I have ever used"
418040,3,"I buy the Klorane Gentle dry shampoo with Oat Milk, usually and like it much better. Not only does the Sebo not add volume, it does not seem to absorb the oil with out using a lot of product. What makes this purchase even more disappointing is that the two bottles did not last me even a month compared to my usual half bottle/month usage."
472203,5,"My favorite. My face feels so good. I use it all the time,not just at nite."
235876,4,"This was recommended by my dermatologist and I love glytone.  Your skin feels so clean after use, I use it with my clairsonic pro brush."
544364,3,"The boob cream smells terrible!!!! These products are ok. Don't t think it deserves 5 stars"
44219,4,"Wife loves the basic design with non-basic features.  I would buy again."
8879,5,"Love the color. Not too dark, not too light. Just right!"
106205,3,"For the price I think it should have contained more ounces. The product is good,  leaves my hair soft, silky and the gray shines."
145223,5,"I've always had a Hot Tools curler and I'm never going back! The velvety matte finish will wear off and get sticky eventually, but hey, it's bound to happen with regular wear and tear. Highly recommend it."
500035,5,"Great soaps and smells great"
453534,5,"I received a sample of this product and knew immediately I needed to purchase it in full size. It gives just the right amount of glow, without looking heavy or too dark. It perfectly matches my skintone, and I'll be able to wear it year round."
529133,5,"As someone who seemingly can grow a beard overnight, the plastic razors definitely weren't cutting it. I didn't buy this because some GQ article suggested I would be a more masculine man if I had a safety razor, no no. This is just so damn practical its insane to think any guy uses the plastic stuff. The blades are affordable and way more effective than the plastic stuff, and the durability of this Merkur makes you think youll be shaving with it until your final days. Totally recommend you get one of these, and maybe get one for a friend still using the plastics. Theyll thank you someday."
133472,5,"I'm only 24 and my hair is already thinning. I tried keeping it long, short, etc. Nothing worked. This product is magic. My hair looks better now than it did in high school"
152516,5,"Received this as part of a gift bag, it is by far the best lip moisturizer ever.  Apply with finger.  Not sticky. No weird tastes. Heals wind burn. Actually moisturizes and heals chapped lips. The best product I have ever used at 30+ I feel like I have tried everything. I will buy this product over and over again."
52655,5,"Nice strong manlier smell. goes great if you are going out for some whiskey or going to have some scotch. compliments a man's manliness well a fresh smell of man to spray over the man. It smells good I get lots of compliments on it. ""Whats that smells... it smells good, who is that...(trying to find the person wearing it... secretly me...)"" ""You smell nice"" or ""You smell good"" sometimes they will repeat that same compliment with ! a few minutes later and get closer... Good stuff"
419435,1,"I have been using the system for about two months and I absolutely love it. I use the cleanser with my clarisonic and I notice a considerable improvement in my acne prone, hyperpigmented skin. I notice a lot less acne breakouts and a quicker turnaround in clearing up any small breakouts that occur. I have used a lot of products over the years, like Clinique, prosac, neutrogena, olay products and I have found nothing that effectively controls acne like Effaclar. Because acne is what causes acne scarring and hyperpigmented areas, Effaclar addresses the root of the problem in controlling the acne. Thanks La Roche Posay lab!"
192263,3,"Wen styling cream is one of the only products that works on my hair without making it too stiff or too frizzy. The reason for the three stars is because this lavender scent really reeks! The almond mint is much better. Another thing I wish about it is that it came in a bigger container. My curls require a lot of product, and these just don't last."
182638,4,"Within a day or two your problem zit is gone! This stuff is legit no lie."
196991,5,"I was really sad when Crabtree and Evelyn closed their stores because this was one of my favorite scents.  I have purchased other Sandalwood sprays and none of them were close to this one."
137619,5,"Love this face lotion!"
185254,1,"This product is a complete lie. They make it hard to see the real list of ingredients, and the second ingredient is sodium lauryl sulfate. I had already used it a few times before thinking to look anyway... even though it is called ""Zerosulfate"". I will never buy a Pureology product again."
560788,4,"I normally order LashFood but that's been on backorder for sometime so I decided to give another Cruelty-Free make-up remover a try. The formula is light, though a bit oily and easily removes makeup, leaving my skin feeling moisturized. The price was a bit higher than I'd have liked to pay, but the reviews were good and I always try to give new Cruelty-Free products a try so I would recommend this remover."
468279,1,"I purchased this based on reviews. This very expensive product is a waste of money.  It does not exfoliate. It does ball up but I did not see any change in color.  I did not see or feel any difference in my skin. Don't waste your hard earned money."
23974,5,"I have used Toppik for years ... great aid for thinning hair ... SHH! It's a secret.  Won't leave home without it."
97712,5,"This is without a doubt the best nail file anywhere. I wouldn't be without it. I even got one for my husband who loves it as much as I do."
573325,2,"I love this stuff but for the amount you get, not worth buying. I'll stick to the facial wash they sell."
454522,5,"Im a BIG fan of this stuff! I tried the fibers (same brand), and while they worked like a charm, they were messy and impossible for me to apply correctly (mainly because I have a tremor in my hand).

Enter, SPRAY ON HAIR! This stuff is awesome! Shake it up, spray it on let it dry a bit and brush through to prevent looking slick like Squiggy. Or was is Lenny? Anyway- you get it.

Best thing ever: I fell into the lake two days ago and was FREAKING OUT because I thought when I climbed out of the water, my guests would see black streaks running down my forehead like some weird, lake monster. Guess what? NOT A SMEAR. Not a drop. Nada.

I went into the bathroom and it was still there, right where I left it. It didn't come out until I applied shampoo and washed it out! Yay!!

Now, I will say that its gonna rub off a bit onto pillowcases. Not much- it can be avoided by using dark pillowcases. Easy peasy. White cases in the hotel I stayed in looked a bit dusty afterward- not too bad.

Hats are another story. I wear the spray at the crown and on the top, and it DOES rub off on the inside of my ballcaps. Luckily, it washes out.

Also: If you run your fingers through your hair, you're gonna wanna STOP doing that, because your hands will resemble a coal miners. Unless you use gray, red or blonde spray, in which case I have no idea what happens. After you spray and let it dry, brushing through will feel stiff, but do it a few times and itll look more natural. Beware: some color will come off onto your brush, so don't let it touch your clothes. And when spraying, press down on the spray cap HARD because if you dont, the product will dribble out in drops and stain your face, clothes, etc. it washes out, but why waste your time.

All in all, if you're a 45 year old woman who is losing her hair, I highly recommend this product. Other people might like it too. "
263259,1,"No noticeable difference in length, thickness or darkness of lashes & have been applying it 2x/day."
404085,3,"I was hoping for a nice spring yellow color, but when I painted it on my nails it was much lighter than I expected. I know everyone's computer screen is different but mine looks like a much bolder yellow than the product that arrived. I think it's almost more of a tan/yellow or even nude. There is a lot of white pigment which washes out the yellow color. I just ordered the bicycle yellow shellac and I am hoping it is the bright yellow I was hoping for when I purchased this one. Maybe my bottle was part of a bad batch or something but I was disappointed..."
240816,5,"Have used for a long time.  Great concealer!"
486478,5,"My favorite foot cream by far.  Highly recommend but try to only purchase this product in this new updated packaging.  It is fresh and there is lots of older product floating around out there on Amazon and eBay.  Definitely worth treating your feet to this one and I also really like the smell."
198853,5,"Great soap"
210761,5,"Definitely a splurge, I am not going to lie... it hurts the wallet thinking you'll be spending it on a $120 brush, but how many brushes do you buy in a lifetime?  The last one I had lasted 5 years and snapped at the handle - typical drug store brand.  I figured since I've overhauled all of my makeup and hair tools to high-end toys, I might as well get a brush worth having as well...

This brush polishes your hair with just a few strokes - any nasty coarse strands are suddenly silken and beautiful after running this through your hair.  It definitely delivers what it promises; the combination of boar bristles and plastic massages my scalp without being too harsh on my skin.  It's VERY light weight (I was expecting something a bit heftier) but over use, I've come to realize I like lighter items in my hand as it doesn't stress your arms (great news for hair dressers or people with arthritis) or hands.

This is NOT the type of brush for a person that likes something that does it ALL.  I would NOT recommend combing your hair with this wet - EVER.  This is something you would use on dry hair for a quick brush through to de-tangle or polish during styling.  It is not something to use with a hot blow-dryer and it won't curl your hair or cook breakfast for you.  =P

It's definitely worth it in my book because I am a SUCKER for tools and gadgets worth having that can make my life easier/nicer.  This makes my hair shiny without having to put it through heat if I don't have to and it reduces the amount of product I have to use.  I definitely appreciate the simple craftsmanship and my only gripe would be that I have to clean it from the hair that collects in the bristles.  - That's OK though, since the brush does come with a separate brush to ""Brush"" your brush?  LOL... I know it sounds weird, but that's what it is and it works.  Hope this helps and I hope you get it!  It's a fine luxury brush definitely worth owning.  =)"
6163,5,"Love this.  It is neutral and a great price.  It is exactly as it appears in the photo and I really appreciate that.  I was at my local Sally's Beauty Supply and OPI is now selling for $10.15 per bottle!"
218746,5,"I recently purchased this for a lengthy trip to Europe where I packed everything in a backpack. It is dual voltage so I didn't need to worry about buying a converter (just an adapter), and the straightener is very small so it added almost no weight to my backpack. This is the smaller version of my regular straightener so I assumed it would work great and it did. I would recommend getting the 1 inch plate opposed to the 1/2 inch just for time saving purposes."
358688,1,"Do NOT buy this product. It is nothing like product sold in salons or department stores"
533833,5,"Great"
291894,1,"Why is this product so expensive? This price is ridiculous !"
339044,3,"Overall, I like this Iron so far.  Build quality seems decent enough and is balanced well.  It is also a little unusual in its design.  Specifically, the bumps on the wand are intended to prevent slipping but on a few occasions, we noticed it left varying degrees of bumps in our hair.  However, the results are very good.  The 9 foot cord is also very welcome and it does not get tangled."

190775,4,"The Loew's Minneapolis hotel provided MOMO shampoo to guests. Loved it. Great scent, yellow color. Ordered on line, discovered it was same fine cleansing capabilities but much more medicinal scent. The shampoo color is green. No complaint about the shampoo or the color, but the scent is not as pleasing."
550838,1,"I've been using this product for about a month. I have not noticed any improvement in my skin. VErykah expensive and no results."
66327,1,"Horrible.  Threw it away!  Drys and makes wrinkles where there aren't any."
522120,5,"After a yesr of heavily processing my hair it obviously left my hair brittle, dry and damaged. I searched for the best conditioner for soft shiny hair and rusk was in the top 5. I of course read the other reviews which are great. This stuff makes my hair not only managable but leaves hair feeling healthy and soft smoothing down bad dead ends"
45274,1,"This product is crap. Not only does it tangle my hair every time I put it on high, but now I smell burning from it and the thing started clicking when I turn it on. I haven't had it for very long... only 1.5 years?! My last hair dryer lasted at least 5.  Disappointed and will not purchase again."
485684,5,"I do love me some TonyMoly products. This one is a bit of a surprise to me; I expected a different texture, but once I used it, I realised why it's the way it is. It goes on transparent, but once I apply it, I just want to touch my face (don't, it's a bad habit!)! It makes my skin feel smooth and pore-free."
120723,5,"I have very sensitive skin and this shampoo does not bother my hair or scalp . I don't use a very large amount of the shampoo itself since I have short hair. A little bit goes along way.  It lathers up good.  I like the fact that it lacks many of the synthetic ingredients. Keeps my hair looking great and clean."
507912,5,"Definitely helps my fine hair to have more body without adding weight to it."
48794,3,"I purchased the 90 day whitening system.  There is a morning application, evening application and a weekly application.  The kit includes 5 weekly whitening treatments - which is less than half a 90 day supply.  The other interesting point is that this must be geared to people with really badly stained teeth.  They include a color chart to track your progress whitening.  My teeth aren't especially white,, pretty average I think.  But I matched between two whitest options.  That will make it hard to track any real progress.  I've been using it for 5 days exactly as directed and haven't seen a difference yet but it may take longer - despite the commercials.  It I'll use it for a bit longer, but will cancel it before the next automatic shipment comes in if I don't notice any progress.

Keep in mind you don't get a full 90 day supply of everything and it seems to be geared toward severely stained teeth."
559496,1,"product made eyelids swell....must of been allergic to it.  If you have glaucoma, I would not recommend it."
76512,5,"Great product"
452565,5,"Never expected such great results in such a short time! This is a fantastic product.  I wish I would have discovered it years ago.  The waiting 10 min in between each step eliminated the burn completely."
472018,5,"Love this nailpolish and great value without all the crap chemicals in other brands of NP."
161112,5,"Easy to use. This shade works great for myself and a friend.
Just  be sure to put it on evenly. ."
520380,3,"Serves, but not as effective or pleasant smelling as hoped or expected. After trying one time immediately bought another brand similar product - sensual rose salt scrub, highly recommended."
245044,5,"This is a mircle product!  I initally bought this product from a med spa but turned to amazon when the spa couldn't keep it in stock.  Over the last 6 months it has reduced my fine lines, puffiness, and dark under eye circles.  I believe it is worth the extra expense becasue the bottle lasts a very long time."
448707,5,"Workssss like a charmmmm"
264260,5,"The bottle alone would sell this cologne. The cologne is pretty good too, though."
155504,1,"Although I absolutely love Jane Iredale- This one I believe to either have gone bad or a fake somehow. This was my first time purchasing this item via Amazon back in January 2017. It is now August 2017, so I have been able to thoroughly test it. This product, in general, has always looked lovely, but this specific item has been awful. I was hoping it was just my brush or moisturizer or primer or what have you.
Moving forward, I will just be buying from the spa or online."
220748,5,"Hair dryer has good temp. and really good pressure -- I am very pleased with it. I use it with a diffuser on ""low"" and it works great.

Diffuser that fits well is the ""Babyliss Pro Nano Titanium Universal"""
421772,5,"So far so good. I used lanza shampoos back in England. Since moving to the states every hairdressers have told me to use Redken, or Kerastase. Both were horrible with my hair. Since using Lanza again, my hair is not dry, brittle or uneasy to style. I thank lanza for my beautiful hair back."
192341,1,"Last week I used the styling crme for the first and last time.  I only used about a dime size amount in my mid-length hair, but it felt awful.  If I had had time, I would have shampooed it out!  It didn't help style my hair at all, it just made it feel incredibly dirty. My hair tangled terribly, was very heavy and limp, looking oily even though I had shampooed right before I applied the crme.  Also, took forever to dry my hair that morning.  Definitely do not recommend!"
234570,5,"Works good at a nice Price!"
440654,5,"great quality does the job in half the time your curly iron"
415965,5,"Freaking miraculous. I have sensitive, acne-prone skin and I have always struggled with wearing sunscreen on my face (like I knew I should) because it broke me out, stung or both. This stuff absorbs instantly, doesnt smell, and doesnt aggravate my skin. Not shiny, sticky, or goopy, none of that ghastly white tint left behind, just smooth skin. THANK YOU!"
285366,1,"The color does not show at all! It's almost just a clear lip gloss!  extremely unhappy especially given the price"
315681,5,"LOVE this product. Not sparkly, just shimmery. NOT for someone who likes a matte look and avoids a dewy finish. Living in the PNW the dewyness is great to combat the ashyness our constant gray clouds create on faces. Leaves me looking fresh all day. Was also happy mine didn't come shattered! Was sealed in tightly with my other products and delivered by Ontrac (who despite bad reviews for, ive had really good service from). Very happy. If yours arrives broken there IS a way to fix broken powder- just google it! I was prepared to fix mine just in case lol"
357851,5,"Great Hair Detangler , I have used this for about five years now , the lady that does my hair was the first time i had it in my hair & thier salon sells it for a much higher price . My hair is super thick , with this it makes taking care of it alot easier after washing , the smell is heavenly . If you don't blow dry though it sometimes will look & feel hard & dry in places as if you got soda or something in your hair by accident . I learned to use it sparingly , a light mist all over then rub it in with hands ."
525851,5,"This is a great cream.  I live in the mountains and it is very dry up here.  I was determined not to let the dryness and the altitude age my face when I moved here.  This is the best I've found and I have tried many."
334979,3,"This shaving does it's job. However there are two thing to notice about it. First' this shaving soap is extremely and quite difficult to create a nice rich foam with it. I have a small bowl to work with and chunks of it kept getting out because it will simply not foam easily. Warm water of course helps, but occasionally I will find that chunks will get stuck on my brush. My recommendation is to get a bigger bowl or maybe even a nice mug to be able to work with it. And second, and perhaps this is more of personal taste than anything, but this soap is QUITE minty. And sometimes it does give like a burning sensation, but then again this might just be my skin.

Overall, I recommend this product, specially if you a bowl big enough to work with it comfortably."
78047,5,"Not that cheap, but I can see the difference in my skin. The price is better that what I paid at the cruise where I tried it the best time."
455721,5,"Last's almost all day and has a beautiful tone, came package very nicely."
275757,5,"I have tried a bunch of pomades but didn't really like something about them. Each have had their downfall. I have used this pomade a bunch of times and it seems to be the best. It doesn't leave you feeling overly greasy. The smell is pretty good, it's not overwhelming and I actually like it. It does not have the strongest hold but good enough to hold hair in place all day. My favorite part is it washes out very easily. I have noticed with some pomades, it can be very difficult to wash out completely. This product comes out with little effort."
163871,5,"Works great"
277756,3,"No difference between this and the cheap stuff. I like that it's organic...but for the price, no way."
130420,5,"I love it!!"
341818,5,"5 stars for a gold polish that isn't just glitter. This is a nice metallic gold. It looks like Minx and doesn't chip. I've had it on for a week now and it still hasn't started to chip away. I love it."
306646,4,"This was the first time I've gone beyond the $50 price point on a hair dryer, and for the most part, I'm glad I did. The best part about this dryer is the result: my hair comes out sleek and shiny and requires minimal styling after. It's also very light weight which is nice.

My biggest gripe is the on/off switch - it's so sensitive that with every drying, I'm constantly accidentally turning it off. Chalk it up to operator error, but I haven't experienced this with other dryers.

All in all, could you get the same quality results with a cheaper dryer? Maybe, but not one that I've yet found. Overall, very happy with my purchase."
546338,4,"Good volumizing mousse for fine hair"
450991,1,"I am a 22 year old male with long hair and regular diet and exercise. I had noticed quite a bit of thinning on the top of my scalp (not receding, just thinning) and decided to use this product along with the Nioxin shampoo and conditioner System 2 since thats the one that corresponds with my hair type. I immediately noticed that i felt a bit of tingle whenever I would apply the Minoxidil drops but thought nothing of it. After a few weeks I noticed quite a bit of itching on my scalp and soon noticed my scalp would actually bleed at the slightest scratch. I got a bit worried but it looked like my thinning area was filling out so i ignored it. Then I remembered the ""vertex"" area on the back of the head thats illustrated on the box and decided to take a picture with my phone. Imagine my horror when I saw an enormous bald patch on my head that definitely wasn't there before. I went to see a doctor and he said that my scalp was not only inflamed but infected, which is what was causing the unbearable itching. I was prescribed antibiotics and anti-inflammatory meds and it seems to have fixed the itch and bleeding. I am continuing to use the shampoo and conditioner and hope it will fix the patch but i will never use this specific product again."
392116,5,"great price"
412355,3,"This shampoo smells like HEAVEN. You don't need too much, either. I found that my hair was drying out from this product, which I never had happen before. Use it very sparingly."
364688,5,"just what I needed."
462449,1,"I ordered this product by mistake and it's soooo bad it's streaky and it doesn't blend AT ALL. I would give this product 5 stars if I could"
50421,5,"I have been using this parfum for 3 years now. It has the best scent out of all other parfumes I ever used. I usually order it online, but some people say it might be fake, and i can say it is the original product. This parfume is my signature now and I am sure I will be using it for long time in the future."
507486,5,"I love this body lotion. I usually take my shower in the evening and apply this lotion after,  the following morning, my skin is supple and smooth."
408239,5,"My kids who HATE sunscreen LOVE this because they can't feel it on their skin at all!"
533340,2,"I am not a fan of this shampoo. For reference, I have fine hair but a lot of it, with a slight wave and a tendency to frizz. This shampoo made my hair even more frizzy than normal, even with my normal heat-styling routine (which includes several Leonor Greyl products). I read where someone compared the fragrance of this shampoo to that of Chanel. I totally agree as this is very aldehydic and I am so not a fan. I much prefer their Reviviscence shampoo for performance and fragrance. With the Reviviscence I don't tend to need conditioner, my hair is silky with less frizz, and the fragrance of it reminds me of the Huile de Palm, which I love. I am sure this would work for somebody but it definitely missed the mark for me."
357912,5,"Love this product!!!! And shipping was great!"
248486,4,"Product is fine, but has intensive scent, it does not stick or anything like that, but just stronger fragrance that other hair treatments.
Works on my hair fine."
28332,5,"The nude perfector is very nice on your nails.  Makes them look really natural.  Love Zoya products!"
257834,5,"I like this product for ease of use and making my cuticles feel pampered. I have seen fewer hangnails with regular use."
252091,2,"Can't see my eyelashes because the plastic covers most of my eye making it very difficult to see where I'm placing the curler.  The scissors type work much better for me."

He refuses to use anything else now! He thought he lost it, so that was A HUGE problem:) Have to tell him that amazon sells it, so he wants to stock up!!!"
488228,5,"Love the scent and their other products too. They need to make a travel sized option with a leak proof lid."
409245,5,"Great sulfur free shampoo.  Leaves hair soft and manageable and it smells great too."
490069,1,"Reason I say one is the perfume smell from it is so strong its giving me a major headache..... make something not so strong Im very not satisfied"
413384,4,"Excelent, very good"
46204,5,"I got this straightener for my birthday, and I love it! It leaves my hair very soft and smooth. Doesn't make my hair look dead and dry on the ends like my previous flat irons have done. It gets hot VERY quickly and the detachable comb comes in handy. I would definently recommend this straightener for anyone with thick curly/wavy hair. I use it along with my babyliss pro diamond hair dryer and the end result is salon quality!"
331741,5,"Once you try it, you will never be able to go back to your old foundation. Its buildable coverage and the bonus concealer lasts for a long time. My only complaint is I wish it was a pump because when I'm running out of it, there's still quite alot of foundation in the bottle but I can't get it out! So it goes to waste and I hate that. Buy this though cause you'll love it! lol"

146091,5,"Great gift for my wife, she is happy with it."
234795,3,"I bought this to help with the ingrown hairs al over my thighs. It helped a little in the beginning but then stopped working after a while. Be cautious when using, it can burn."
372421,3,"This is a lovely fragrance with complex notes that come together beautifully. It is an unusual fragrance unlike anything I have experienced before.  However, it has no lasting power and after an hour or so, the fragrance disappears.  .I am thinking that layering will help and I will consider purchasing a lotion to help this fragrance stay around longer."
229202,5,"Simply put: I LOVE THIS RAZOR! Such a nice feel in the hands. A heavy razor that does all the work for me. Built from quality. I recommend this product to any DE shaver, new or old. Get it! Worth the money!"
411726,4,"Nice smell and very light on the hair. My hair feels softer and more nourished. Product arrived quickly and well packaged."
104971,4,"I am not a cosmetic chemist but a chemist nonetheless. I have worked with creams and gels of the like. I don't agree with the previous reviewer that it is grease. In fact, I always come back to this product because it does not feel ""watery"" which a lot of the moisterizers out there tend to be. This is not labeled as a ""clinical strength"" moisterizer but I consider it a very nice balance that sets it apart from the rest. It is in the pricey range but do like the fragance and definitively the texture...and I do not work for Crabtree, fyi (though if they are paying attention, I can send my resume ;) )."
382922,5,"Makes me happy that the person I gave it to you loved it!  Original brand and good Price! I recommend"
501965,5,"Love it and get compliments when I wear it. It's my signature scent."
487420,5,"This is a fantastic beard oil. I got it on recommendation from GQ, and I was not disappointed. The smell is nice, woodsy, clean. It goes on well, and keeps your beard soft, without making it feel too oily."
570537,1,"Not worth the money. Did nothing for me."
71697,5,"Great product. Reminds me of Dr. Bronner's old Peppermint soap that I used to use when back-packing. Felt like your scalp was on fire..., in a good way (I miss the commentary on those old bottles). This shampoo seems a tad milder and is bracing enough to be part of any full-blooded wakeup ablutions. I look forward to using it every day..., just one of those things that enriches a day."
150955,5,"beyond compare"
491207,5,"Was aka Helen of Troy Professional Flat Iron. I had one for years and it recently stopped working on one side, so I stopped in at Sally Beurty Supply's local store, but they stated they'd been discontinued. I was so bummed, as this was my second one to bite the dust over the years and I liked the way it held up for so many years. I searched online and found Amazon carried it, but under a different name now. Ordered it and it is identical to my old one. Have only used it once so far, but this is the only flat iron that heats up enough to straighten my naturally spiral curls, even after a blow dry to straighten. Love it!! Swear by this one. So, if you're looking for a flat iron that really heats at a high temp and can flatten those natural curls, try it and I guarantee you will not be disappointed."
223445,5,"This blow dryer cuts my hair drying time in half compared to my last blow dryer! It blows hot and cuts some of the frizz too!"
119563,2,"Comes in a tube, that is not that large.  Expected a bottle that stood upright or had  a pump.  Not worth the $$"
418310,5,"Heats evenly and fast.  Great for straightening and smoothing my medium to fine hair.  Adds movement and just the right amount of lift to crown without curling tightly."
209493,4,"I was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves. I like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and I am not made of money ya know. As a mass produced soap it's actually really nice. It loads well, though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones. The scent is nice and has some staying power. The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well. A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better. without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti-inflammatory properties."
198456,5,"THis is the bst product ever for under eye puffiness! Thanks to my bad genes I have huge bags under my eyes every morning when I wake up! I put these on after I shower and leave on for a good 20min and poof the puffiness is GONE! Well worth the money and I re-use each pair at least 6 times not the 2-3 times they recommend."

173084,5,"LOVE"
463950,3,"I have brown hair and brown eyes, and the color of this works for me. The only reason I am not a fan is because it tends to make my lips feel chalky or dry. In the wintertime, I have chapped lips often and this makes them even dryer. BUT I think that is probably to be expected because it is matte. Also, I've noticed that this tends to get quite messy because it's thicker.

PROS
- Long wear
- Great color
- Smells kind of minty

CONS
- Messy
- Drying"

It also looks very natural and blendable. The only issue for me personally is that it is not pigmented enough to offer enough coverage for dark circles under eye."

This is great shampoo !
I do not have to shampoo daily like I used to and you do not have to use a lot of it.

18284,5,"The LOreal Dermablend Professional line of cosmetics is new to me.  They earn being in a higher-end category in my opinion. They do not seem to be scented or too chemical. The jars, tubes, compacts are made very sturdy to last along with your make-ups. I have many favorites among them, yet I believe they all stand very well on their own. Some two or more of these creamy products come with an application spatula, and this appears to be an optional extra.  Also, there is a little instruction leaflet included with every product.

I have been using LOreal products since the 1980s when my best friend was wearing a frosted lipstick I liked and I later sought out.  It smelled good too. It was a truer color in my eyes, since many comparable brands were putting red tinges into the light pinks and such.  Also, some of the LOreal colors of lipsticks and eyeshadows were pearly, and I liked them because they looked very ethereal, as with the pink-violet lipstick that changed colors depending on the light.

I have aged, and my last purchase was a LOreal Infallible product, one of many in a line which rarely or never need reapplication for my creased lids and bitten lips. I have been so obsessed that I have a whole zipper case full of the eyeshadows alone. I have a lot of products from their Visible Lift line for my skin texture. I especially enjoyed the Blur ones.  Now I am going to move on to have more choices in my zip bag.

There has been more exposure with LOreal in my experience than I can mention here, including most recently, a lovely reddish-brown shade of eyeshadow that stays put, a super-mascara, another lip paint, some face-tone enhancers, and a creamy-to-dry, light-colored eye light, among others.
I am happy to see more high-end products from LOreal that should work well for young and old alike, especially since it seemed to me years ago that their products were for my younger crowd.

  1. DERMABLEND COVER CR&Egrave;ME WITH TITANIUM DIOXIDE SUNSCREEN (30SPF):
This is the first item in this line of Dermablend cosmetics from LOreal that Ive received, and it is my very favorite.  It covers my skin imperfections well.

My first attempt with it doesnt count, since I spread it very thin, allowing a bit of dermatitis I had at the time to show some dry skin through.  And I went out that night wondering why this was happening.  I hadnt read the instructions yet.  First of all, I thought I needed to get rid of the rash that was there before reapplying and reviewing this product, and second, I thought I needed to exfoliate since I have dry patches on spots.  Now I get it!  This particular cr&egrave;me has to be built up gradually for me. And building it up judiciously is not problematic at all.  This product is soft and smooth.  It appeared to be a very thin product at first, and it kind of softens and blends as you work with it.  It is lovely.

If I use a sponge applicator it will ruin one purpose of it for me which is to cover varying imperfections; and when I apply it with smoothing dabs it appears blended, and I really find out how radiant and thorough a cover cream make-up can be.  It has alone a bit of chroma to it, as does Dermablend Pro Smooth Liquid Camo Medium Cover Foundation (25 SPF),  in my opinion, unlike many other cover products I have used. Alone, they gleam in the light more than my other cover make-ups, without chalkiness.  Very nice.

The other purpose for me is that it has a (30 SPF) sunscreen.  ALL other cosmetics with sunscreen I have tried have (25 SPF) or lower, and not my needed (30 SPF) that my dermatologist recommends.  She has said that even in my home with shades closed I am exposing my skin to potential damage.  I score 1,000 % here for this as well as the other qualities of this line.

The two colors I have are both medium ones, one a bit lighter, and both appropriate for me, especially my indulgence of mixing other lighter or darker colored LOreal Dermablend Pro products with them.

Ive been feeling a bit like a chemist with the many LOreal Dermablend Pro products listed here. And I realize you may not have this type of a menu, but I am hoping this info will help somehow to see the flexibility here if not anything else.

2. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL TRANSLUCENT LOOSE SETTING POWDER (NO SPF):
needed. The wonderful cr&egrave;mes I love work nicely with Loreal Dermablend Professional Translucent Loose Setting Powder with micronized powder, with the cotton puffs. It hides flaws when that is part of what you are going for.  This particular product is very fine, not grainy, and perhaps a bit creamy.  It definitely blends in well.  It is very nice for creating a thin and matte next barrier, keeping the cr&egrave;me, bases, foundations, from smudging to hands, clothing.  In various ways, since Amazon is not going to know my exact skin color, I have experimented, I am able to get some creative looks I sought in using the various loose powder shades together:
 Dermablend Pro Translucent Loose Setting Powder in my three separate medium shades (separate jars); when applied and then dusted off created light on dark or dark on light look as I so chose.

A. What I mean is that with the lighter shade of cr&egrave;me I was able to get the same look with the darker powder, as with the opposite of that technique using the darker cr&egrave;me and a lighter powder. Altogether, with these medium shades I was able to get a perfect match, thus prolonging my experience.

B. Also, with the white translucent powder I have found that I am getting a more dimensional look by applying the light shade powder on certain areas of my face, and on top or around in certain areas like cheeks, nose, chin, forehead, I will carefully apply and moments later lightly dust the medium-toned translucent powders as described, allowing it to not look quite so much like monotone matte over my sallow complexion.  Another plus 1,000%! For me.

I have found recently that I need to put on fine dustings of all powders for myself personally; and not necessarily all over my face and neck.
U have been using a bit of bright cream blush oddly enough, though you may find it unnecessary; you can still have a dimensional look.

I like to play with the powders, yet, when I am in a rush I will make errors, not being subtle, and not dusting before other products.  Also, I am 62, and my baggy under-eye application errors are the most noticeable. I get rid of this bagginess first.  I will use the powders now, especially with other lighter Dermablend cr&egrave;me applications, or with the high-quality Dermablend Pro Smooth Liquid Camo Medium Cover Foundation (25 SPF) listed below; and as well as their other foundations. All definitely for photos where a shine or two really counts.

One thing that helps give a nice touch over the powders and such is the Loreal Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray. The powders are probably quite wonderful for an oily skin type, for example; they are nice for a youthful complexion; and I believe they are going to look quite radiant on a woman with less-noticeable pores, and without wrinkle issues along with age and skin texture combined.  In my case I am fine, and safest when I am well-rested.

3. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL SET + REFRESH LONG-LASTING MAKE-UP SETTING SPRAY (NO SPF):
These Dermablend base products are synergistically enhanced with a nice sheen of fresh with a spray application of Loreal Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray. Just lightly mist your face with your hair pulled back to enhance your look and seal your make-up applications.  The mist isn't as fine as I had expected, but it works for me.  Even with dusted powders it will make a difference.  It is that simple for me.

4. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL SMOOTH LIQUID CAMO MEDIUM COVER FOUNDATION (25 SPF):
This a product that I had underestimated until today when I applied it under Dermablend Pro Translucent Loose Setting Powder, which may not be necessary if you want that chroma look; yet because I preferred the varying built-up applications I achieved with the Dermablend Professional Cr&egrave;me, I missed something with trying this last.  As before I was too quick to judge.  I had applied it very thick and then I went out.  I thought to myself that is was mask-like, yet nice moist cover.

Not only can I spot- apply this creamier-liquidy product to cover the face and problem areas with my fingers, I can also use a sponge blender for a more airbrushed look, then applying more product wherever as needed. I also can add a finishing touch of the Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray for a fresh stay; with or without powders. Win-Win-Win.

5. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL INTENSE POWDERCAMO!! (NO SPF):
This is a lovely and creamy intense powder in a nice mirrored compact with a sponge applicator, in separate compartments.  While this color is quite dark for me, one quality, besides the products ability to render a fine cover layer if desired, is that I do not see wrinkles really.  Maybe the thin layer or the creaminess?  And the staying power, especially with the fresh mist of Loreal Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray.  Also, I can dab and smooth this powder wherever I want to whatever area of the face or neck.  The darker color, applied gently is making a nice bronzer if applied thin.  I do know that is stretching it though. I haven't tried it over the above LOreal Dermablend Professional Liquid Camo product, since this is a very dark color; however, I suppose this might possibly work; though this does go on thin, and I do not think a cr&egrave;me or foundation is needed to get a good look. Very nice camo cover product!

6. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL QUICK-FIX BODY (NO SPF):
Wow again.  I hadnt understood at first how I can use this, as one of the colors I own is a darker bronze; and while I hadnt yet noticed the medium (my shade).  I mistakenly applied some of the dark under my cheekbones to see a defined look which actually worked for me, yet thick as I applied it - and silly me! I am thinking that since this product says body in the title it is going to be nice for use on varicose veins and other body imperfections like a permanent rash I have. Double win with this product results!

This is a creamy roll-up stick cover product which does the job without rubbing off too much. I love the idea of having a smooth body-skin look as with the generous tube of the wonderful, and long-lasting Dermablend Professional Leg and Body Make-Up; however, Im mentioning this Quick Fix product first as Im partial to a more natural, yet youthful, look, only working with the blemishes and letting the natural skins still show through.  This is my personal preference.  It isn't quite going to be looking as flawlessly airbrushed overall as with the full body make-up, yet it is the product I will use first; especially during the day. I love it.

7. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL LEG AND BODY MAKE-UP (SPF25):
It is so nice to wear tights, stockings, or nylons during the Winter to have confidence that leg imperfections will not be seen with dresses, and on ankles under pants above boots.  However, during cooler months especially, it is very nice to see perfect body skin peeking out of your clothing.  Not only does this product render a flawless airbrushed look, it is actually very resistant to liquid or rubbing off onto hands or clothing.  I absolutely loved the look when I put it on; and then darn, I was noticing in the light that my shade was a bit peachier than my actual sallow skin.  This might not be problematic for you with full-body applications, as for me on an occasional basis as desired; yet finding your closest match will save you a lot of bother, and will please you I believe.  As I have expressed that this product renders a nice, airbrushed look, and I believe even because of the staying power alone this Dermablend Pro product is worth looking into.  It just didn't muss up and rub off.

8. LOREAL DERMABLEND QUICK-FIX CONCEALER STICK (SPF 30)
This works fabulously; it is creamy and it stays put; it is smart just as the LOreal Dermablend Professional Cover Cr&egrave;me, because it has that strength of sunscreen that my dermatologist recommends, even as I am in my home, shades drawn, as my dermatologist has warned about.  I have already sun damage under my right eye where there is a dark spot.  This covers very well, looks flawless with or without other products, yet it works synergistically with the wonderful LOreal Dermablend Pro line. I have it in a tan color, and I would have thought since I usually use lighter shades of concealers that it would not have looked so perfect with my medium skin. Lovely. Plus 1,000%, and very smart.

Very nice products indeed.  Enjoy!"
379570,5,"Wonderful product. It takes the friz out with just a few sprays.  Leaves hair shiny too. Love this product. Last quite awhile."
451236,3,"I've used other root concealers and at the recommendation of my stylist, tried this one.  The color match is great, and I like the mild scent, but unfortunately this transferred onto everything, including my glasses when I had them on top of my head.  Sadly, someone pointed out that I had brown marks on the sides of my nose - so that's how I found out it was transferring.  Also the size/amount you get for this price is ridiculous.  Would not purchase again, and am going back to using Keranique."
60193,5,"This is for my daughter.  She likes it."
400903,4,"Not sure it is helping wrinkles but seems like it is good moisturizer."
496947,5,"This product is amazing, great on any skin type. Highly recommend!!"
273258,4,"This product was recommended to me by my son.  I really like how simple it is and how well it works."
534426,5,"This is the second time I've purchased this blush and I absolutely love it. It is my go-to blush for All Occasions"
69367,5,"I'm not someone that curls their hair lots but I have a triple barrel Marcel iron from hot tools as well and really like that one and the way I can handle it easily. I only really used this one twice and like it as well. I am still figuring it out and have to get used to handling it as well but I don't go out much cuz I'm a stay at home mommy. So far the iron seems to get hot fast, curls hair in a good amount of time and my curls lasted a couple days.  I have thin hair and my hair curls easily if I take small 1 inch sections and leave the iron in for about 10 seconds. But I get lazy and take bigger sections and those curled well too. All in all I would recommend this iron to people who have thin to medium thick hair,  I don't know how well it would work for thick hair."
373100,5,"I love this product, it keeps my grey/white hair bright!"
240443,4,"I have only been using this every day for about 1 month along with the conditioner and thickening styling gel.  So far so good. I'm using it with henna black coloring as well as Rogaine. My hair feels fuller and thicker. I have been using Rogaine for about 1 year. This shampoo seems to be working well in combination. The shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair feeling tingly and invigorated.  Losing very little if any hair and new growth is appearing on the balding area at the crown of my head."
162155,4,"This is my first time trying a product like this. I have pale skin that is somewhat blotchy and my cheeks are always a bit red. If I have a blemish the redness last weeks even after the blemish is gone.  The concealer is really green and a little goes a long way so definitely blend this in thoroughly.  I found that it worked better for me if I used this under a medium to full coverage foundation.  Most days I use a powder foundation due to it being quick and easy but found that the power I was using was too light and the green tint showed through too much for my likening.  I've been using this when I wear full coverage liquid foundation for special occasions and it doesn't look green but takes the red look out and covers well.  This product does help diminish the redness and give a more even complexion."
558551,2,"Nothing special.  Not more shiny than other brands of beard oil, as name and description suggest.  I much prefer Layrite's beard oil.  Pass on this, don't waste your money like I did.  It's already in the trash."
442584,1,"This container is tiny and not even full. Way overpriced for the amount that is in there."
267180,5,"I ordered this color based on the reviews posted - some said a dark brick red while others referred to it as raisin color.  When I put this polish on, several people asked my about my ""black"" polish.  No problems with the product and very fast shipping as with my previous orders. Just wish there were some descriptions of what the color is actually like or some photos."
116697,1,"Seems like a good price, until you get the product, and most of what's in this tube is just water, squirting out, with chunks of lotion floating in it. In the smaller container,  which I have purchased several times, it is pure lotion, so I know exactly what consistency this is supposed to be. This was a rip off. I didn't read these reviews because I'm so familiar with the product, I thought this would be the same but it just is not. Don't fall for the good price per volume! It's a scam!"
70679,1,"The iron is great but because the cord shortens with rotation I've been burned and scared 2x.  Please put a non tangle cord on your powerful iron."
172489,5,"My daughter uses this product."
285937,5,"Excellent"
8468,3,"I needed to cover tattoos on my hands & ordered this product. I selected a color that was too light (my own fault). This product is probably better suited for minor scars/blemishes & not body tattoos. It is very waterproof but didn't fully cover my tattoos. Dermablend leg & body cover was a better choice for me after doing a little research, but this is still a great product."
50979,4,"Not fond of the scent, but it doesnt last long."
133531,2,"wrong color  much too dark..i started with the screen light brown..when ti switched over to choices and prices it decided to make all of those darkbrown and I foolishly did not notice it...so we are stuck with it."
108320,5,"Great shampoo.  Wonderful lemon smell.  Thickens oily hair,"
454286,1,"This is not the correct product. I just opened it to use it and it was a different color and consistency. Smells horrible. I ordered last month bc I was almost done with my current one so I'm passed the refund timeline. Do not purchase!!!"
559446,5,"LOVE it...just wish it did not cost so much."
11848,5,"got the bottle today and its big, usually get the 3.4 but for the price this seemed the better offer. been wearing this stuff for a while and love  it."
540689,5,"I could not find any reviews when I was getting ready to buy this perfume. I am so happy that I did buy this! The smell is so fresh and pretty. My sister in law loves this scent and so does my husband. I also really like this set. It would make a really nice gift."
86670,3,"The brand of the nail polish is great, however the color was not accurately represented on the picture. In stores and online, the color looks more salmon and in reality it was quite orange"
368639,5,"Heavenly! Love love love the smell and the way it makes my hair feels. So expensive, but so far I'm worth it..."
472841,5,"This product works great at reducing eye puffiness. I was a little confused at how to use it since it looks a little strange. I use it with my eye cream and I feel like it makes my eye cream absorb better. I am not sure how well it works with fine lines since I have only been using it for a week. I am 27 years old and do not have many fine lines anyway. I really like how I only have to charge it once and it will work for over 100 times. I like how it uses a ultra silicone skin. I currently have allergies and usually wake up with puffy eyes as a result. This really helps me not look as sick since it reduces the puffiness.

 I received this product at a discount for a honest review with my expierince with this item. These are my own opinions and are not influenced in any way by the vendor."
235274,5,"Absolutely love the Glytone line. This got rid of my KP like nothing else ever has and I've spent many $$ trying."
25542,2,"The product itself is good, although it gives me static all the time, probably it's just my hair.  The packaging was horrible when it arrived, totally damaged and I won't buy from this vendor again."
468532,1,"Bought the big one without realizing it wasn't returnable if I didn't like it. I thought the reviews were promising and I liked that it didn't have any parabens, sulfates or artifical colors in it. Unfortunately, it gave me dandruff. It also has artifical fragrance in it and I think it smells bad, like strong old lady perfume. I could try to get past that part if it didn't give me dandruff. Now I'll never use it again and wasted $25."
227977,5,"I love this product. I can fill it with any type of nail polish remover and it works perfectly every time, cleaned every bit of nail polish. The hard tip helps clean-up a lot. Simply amazing."
3307,1,"This is a fake product. The logo is totally wrong. Also, the authentic product should have OPI logo molded into the shaft of the brush. This isn't even a decent fake!"
337372,5,"Cant beat the price anywhere online and retail, made for a perfect Christmas Presentwill be coming back for future purchases."
59375,3,"Smells like chi. It's okay. Not sure if I liked it or not though."
225310,5,"Amazing product. Not just to be used to prevent humidity - overall great style tamer."
253407,5,"Awesome eyeliner"
40,4,"Great but expensive."
109641,5,"If I had to choose just one skin care product, this would be it.  It really protects from the sun and is a great moisturizer.  I even put it on my arms."
211898,5,"hydrating shine and curl definition great product also good for blow dried hair."
101002,2,"The product does not strengthen nails. Do not spend money"
80042,5,"I knew the product before so still in love with the sensation and the results it brings - fresh and clean hair."
542163,5,"This is one of the best products I have ever used for shine on my baby fine short hair which is also color-treated! Because it is blonde color treated I tend to get those little frizzies on the ends that makes me look like a baby chick. lol This helps control those while adding incredible shine. It also doesn't weigh my hair down like many other products I have tried and had to throw away. Same thing with the fragrance...it's light and disappears almost immediately. In the past, I have had shine products that have such strong fragrances they gave me a headache because the smell followed me around all day long...this one doesn't do that-but the SHINE does!"
145580,1,"This worked great the first 3 times I used it, then it broke!  The barrel would not heat up.  I am returning this!!! :("
423968,5,"A little goes a long way!  Great hold!"
406954,5,"Great"
87795,5,"Lovely and unique color, very classy. The product is great!"

567341,5,"Refreshing"
283491,5,"Love the color.  My daughters also love it.  Try it with romantique for a light neutral color.  Great product and the color is as shown."
152761,5,"Love this shampoo, have used it daily for at least 20 years, and am so glad I can still get it since I do not find it in beauty supply stores here."
115449,5,"I haved used the product for years, and was happy to be able to order it through Amazon. That saved me time."

240829,5,"good cover up"
293189,1,"doesn't get hot enuf...so disappointed"
126061,4,"Very tiny container containing rich, luxurious facial cream. It's meant for dry and very dry skin. It has a wonderful fragrance and absorbs quickly, leaving your skin without any sort of residue at all."
298988,5,"Great  products! I was seriously losing my hair at a scary rapid rate and my hair is already fine & thin. I had a grandmother, an aunt & a sister suffer from baldness, they had some hair but very, very little. I'm not just fighting genetics but pre menopausal  as well, with a stressful job. I've started their line a long with the Hair Booster (LOVE this stuff) and scalp treatment. Not only has my hair loss stopped, but growing some back! I hope it works as well for you too."
475797,5,"Exactly what I wanted!  Looks great in my bathroom!"
230932,1,"This mascara did not live up to it's reviews.  I returned it because it was messy on my eyes.  I will never buy it again."
101764,5,"I use this regularly."
9820,5,"I've used this mist for easily 6+ years. I've tried others but always go back to the Glo Minerals mist. I set my makeup with it & spritz more during the day when it's summer. I have oily combination skin & it's great for my skin type (58 years old)."
574187,5,"Love this fragrance. Was happy to see it in the Mega bottle for a decent price! It is as expected and I have no complaints."

324940,5,"Great lotion, love the scent and how it feels on the skin. Recommend."
379363,5,"Exactly what I was looking for. I've been using it long enough to know it's perfect for me."
131414,2,"I've used Toppik Auburn Fibers for years and have been very happy with it.  However, now they've changed the color and the Auburn is more like a muddy brown than Auburn.  I tried to phone customer service and got a person in Utah who had no clue and kept apologizing to me.  The bottle seems to be made somewhere new too, because it has Auburn/Roux/Rojo on it, rather than the old bottles that just had Auburn on the label.  So best to go to a beauty supply where you can inquire about the product."
31835,3,"Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine is ok but too stiff to work with.  It' ok for a finishing coat but otherwise I do not care for it."
391920,5,"This is the only scent I've worn for years, at least 14.  It is my signature scent and I get complements on it all the time.  My caution for those who didn't like it is that you should never purchase perfume before ""trying it on"" in store.  Perfumes smell differently on different people.  There are lots of scents I simply can't wear.
As far as folks complaining about the price, 85 dollars for the large 3.3 ounce size is in line with all stores I shop in.  Keep in mind that discounters might be selling you the genuine product, but old perfume, which will not smell the same. As perfume ages, like anything else, ha ha, its scent changes.
If Burberry didn't work for you, keep searching for that signature scent and make it yours.  My grandmother always said you want someone to know you've left the room and be all the more melancholy for missing you."
543639,2,"I got this in the nick of time from my Maven box because my Nars primer was officially GONE.  I was looking for an alternative to that product, but it's hard to find a primer to battle my super oily lids.  This actually works quite well, it lasted from about 9am until 11pm.  Around 11 at night I noticed some of my liner being transferred to my upper lid.  This isn't a huge deal, because I usually don't wear my makeup that long.  The primer is a nude color and leaves the eyelids really matte.  I really like this product, but I do think the Nars is a little better, and it's clear in color. It's around the same price, so I will probably go back to Nars when this runs out.

::update:: i've only had this about a month and the product is almost out.  I came back to change my review to two stars because it is in the same price zone as higher end products and it lasted only about a month.  I feel like there's more product in there, but I can't get it out.  such a SHAME.."
96746,5,"very nice. good for pregnancy. gets the dirt off. helped tone down the inflammation."
303292,2,"Nice - but insanely too much money for soap that evidently has healing herbs and other homeopathic qualities - all hearsay."
174497,5,"I love this stuff. I use it daily. I put on my face before makeup and I put it on my beauty blender before applying makeup. not too thrilled about smell but I can deal with it. I have bought at least four times and will continue to buy."
535062,5,"I have very sensitive and after a lot of research, this is a brand that i found and used and have had no problem with at all. In fact, my skin feels amazing after i apply this."

475627,5,"So far so good!! I've been using this for about a week with my own facewash and it works so well. I've been having a problem with acne/dirty under my skin due to clogged pores I'm assuming. I've been trying exfoliants but they just dry my skin out. I was worried because my skin is extremely sesitive and dry, so I was hesitant to buy this because I feared it would make it worse. Nope!! This has successfully opened my pores and my skin is looking great and the amount of small bumps has drastically went down in just a week. So happy I bought this. Perfect for dry skin because it helps clean the dead skin from my face which has been another issue. Very glad I took the leap and bought this. Cute color too :)"
538638,1,"it leaves a bad smell when sweating"
555626,5,"By far this is the best curler I have ever owed. With all of the others autocurlers I could not come close to the roots. And this one comes really close and curls are beautifull and stay in tact for at least 5 days. Love it! The negative side it is very heavy and my hands are getting tired in about 20 minutes. I have long hair and it take me about 45-50 minutes to style. Also it is not dual voltage and I can not travel with it. I only tried steam feature twice and did not notice much difference on my hair with or without it."
236877,5,"I have a very bad case of flare-ups. My chin and lower cheek area gets full of small red irritated bumps and my skin becomes very dry. I have tried so many products including Cetaphil, Eucerene, Dermalogica, homeade oil treatments. This cream has improved my appearance dramatically within a day of my first use. I am definitely using this product morning and night as directed. I love it!"
544339,5,"I was instructed to use this product by a dermatologist along with Glytone stimulating shampoo 3 times a week.  At night I apply the hair lotion and in the morning wash it out with the Glytone stimulating shampoo.  I didn't expect it to work but after 6 weeks I noticed a big improvement.  If you follow these instructions, it will work. I also noticed that I stopped losing hair."
521825,1,"I only used it a few times.. then it stopped working. Called & it was just passed the 90 days.. what a waste of money!!!"
186584,4,"Finally, after all these years, I found a bronzer that is the absolute perfect color for me.  Some are too orange, too light, or shimmery.  My only issue with this is a lot gets wasted bcs I have to tap the blush brush to rid the excess blush, or else I'll get multi-shaded drag marks on my face while applying.  I think I'll only use this on special days to make it last longer."
158613,5,"Best thing ever for your hair. Never makes it feel weighted down or greasy. Try it and I can guarantee you will love it."
524321,5,"First purchased this scent in Arizona at my daughter's friends bridal salon. The girls had me try it and I fell in love with  the very sensual scent and gave up all my other fragrances for this one....It is fabulous..I highly recommend it"
452237,5,"excellent!!! wears really well, great color."
493915,5,"I love this product. I'm a black woman with very curly hair. I've been using this product for about 10 years it has consistently been a great product for styling while my hair has been very short and long. It gives nice shine, light control and beautiful separated curls. I always use it while my hair is damp or wet. You don't need to use much.  It rinses and washes our with very little residue. Highly recommended."
545853,5,"Excellent product, moisturizes with coverage. It is light to apply and provides a nice tan glow."
133538,5,"I sprinkled this on my eggs and yum it was good ! My girl loves it on her wet kitty and spreads wide so I can fill her up"
447439,1,"Did not work
I returned it"
236213,2,"After reading the reviews, I decided to order the lotion, but, it was not as I expected it would be, it did NOT do what it claimed....very disappointed, sent it back, love amazon though!!!!!"
393564,3,"I've been using the fibers for years, recommended by my hair stylist.  Couldn't beat the price of this bonus pack, the jar was bigger and cheaper than at the beauty supply store, and I've seen some of these applicators cost up to $50-60!!

I thought I'd like the applicator so I wouldn't get fibers on my face, in my contacts and all over the bathroom counter, but the applicator was a little ""too"" concentrated.  I'd end up with super dark spots on my scalp that weren't so easy to brush into hair.  So I stopped using that part.

Lately I've been noticing more patchiness of fibers, even when applied evenly. I also don't like how it collects in my fingers when I have an itch.  I have an oily scalp so it's been a little bit of a mess lately when using the fibers.

In general, this product has been great in hiding my scalp in areas of thinning hair.  I don't want to take something that re-grows hair and needs to be taken for life, so this is a good alternative for the appearance of a fuller scalp."
380169,5,"Works amazing as a detangler"
276809,1,"bought this for my airbrush, but it was too thick. I tried putting it on with a brush, but it was too oily and didn't cover well. Even with the primer.  Silicone also caused a breakout.  I'll pay more for the luminesse.  Much cleaner look and lighter feel, and stays put MUCH better. Also no breakouts."
6458,5,"I love this stuff, really works and puts a nice thick professional coat on top too!"
533956,1,"All the product was great but the electro stimulator for around the eyes (the aye attachment) the one with the long metal things was not working well since the beganing and now isnot working atall. I had taking care gentally of each attachment. But this one just stop working. It was my firts time buying at amazon and I just noticed that the garrante is just for 30 days. Is anything that I can do?"
425631,1,"Has anyone looked at the ingredients in this stuff? This is not something you want on your face. Also very low quality and it looks like it."
526944,4,"It's a heavy and thick cream but it's great for the dry winters!! I love L'Occitane products, highly recommend getting this product!!"
473047,5,"I LOVE WHAT CREPE ERASE HAS DONE FOR MY HANDS AND ARMS. MY HANDS AND ARMS  ARE SO DRY AND ALWAYS HAVE HAD CHICKEN SKIN. I SEE A DIFFERENCE ON MY HANDS AND ARMS. I DONT MIND SHOWING MY ARMS. BEFORE I MADE SURE I ALWAYS WORE LONG SLEEVES. NOT ANYMOR."
395967,5,"AMAZING product! I don't personally need that much touching up since I have a full head of hair (no visible balding) except for when I want to do a slick bun/ponytail look. This is the perfect product for those hairstyles that you want to have a perfect middle part, and a full-looking middle part. This is definitely a great buy, a secret that celebrity hairstylists use to make their clients hair look fuller and perfect for the red carpet."
497377,5,"Im beauty product skin care skeptic.  Ive fallen for so many false promises over the years, that its with mixed feelings that I confess - The Elemis Pro-Collagen Skin Care System works!

Ive tried it out several times by using it on only one side of my face, and I really can see the improvement.  In my case, the deep wrinkles are a bit less obvious and deep.  So it seems that those of you will smaller (younger) wrinkles will see even more improvement.

I use it both on days when I go makeup free and on those days that wear foundation.  And it works both ways.

I like it.  I don't think that it erases wrinkles; they're still there.  But for several hours they're less obvious.

I just wish that it were a less expensive option because I doubt that I can walk away."
46895,5,"Great power and heat. Dries hair quickly."
59995,5,"Love this shampoo"
96870,4,"This product has really helped me retain hair as well as grow new hairs. I haven't experienced oily skin or breakouts as other people have. I just wish it didn't have some inactive and perhaps even harmful ingredients like hydrogenated soybean oil, vitamin E, artificial colors, and gluten."
202464,1,"I use Yves Saint Laurent Touche clat and I thought this would work as well since the reviews were so good. It has not worked for me at all. It leaves little solid dots here and there and I can't blend them in. A complete waste of money!"
33593,5,"My husband loves this shaving cream and he loves how smooth it is.  I love the smell of it.  Great Product - we highly recommend."
394972,5,"I used this for my entire pregnancy, from the second I found out I was pregnant until about 6 weeks PP. I highly recommend this lotion! I did a regimen every single morning and night with this and shea butter and never got a stretch mark. I credit this lotion! I will use it for every pregnancy! It also doesn't smell bad to me or my husband, we like it, so that's a bonus! :)"
500106,5,"My favorite. It soaks in without feeling greasy."
294415,5,"I received a sample of all the Stila palettes when I made a purchase at Sephora,and really fell in love with the texture of these eye shadows, and with the very usable colors of this particular palette. With most palettes there are one or two colors I like. Not so with this one! OK, I do have a favorite--Sunset, a shimmery copper that looks great over the entire eyelid and hollow (I haven't worn eye shadow that way since I was in my 20s, but this is a very wearable color).

Sunset also looks great on the brow area, because the shimmer is never glittery. So it works on the brow. Bubbly and Kitten are golden shimmers, perfect for lining and brightening the undereye. Sandstone,Gilded Gold, and and Luster are darker and good for lining the outer edge of my eye.

Bliss is a matte nude tone that, surprisingly, also looks good on my eyebrows, when I don't want them to have too much emphasis. Bare, Night Sky, and Ebony, are still waiting to be tried. I'm not crazy about the Smudge Stick eyeliner. I know they call it a smudge stick, but I like eye liners with a finer point to them that I can control. This will require a bit of practice. It does have a nice soft texture, not requiring a lot of pressure.

Amazon is offering it at a great price, about $10 less than the original offering price of $39.00."
22358,5,"I need to first say that I was very, very skeptical of all of these hair fiber products. The videos just seemed fake based on how much hair just seemingly came out of nowhere. That said, look at my photos! It surely isn't a permanent solution but man, this stuff has helped so much with giving me back some of my confidence. Hair loss is really demoralizing. Some say that's petty... Whatever. When you go through it, it's the worst. At least for a short time, this will help me feel a lot better in public.

The product itself is very easy to use. Just shake it on, tap your hair gently with your hands, and that's basically it. I don't really use it in my hair line as it starts to look a little funny. I'm certain you CAN use it in your hairline but for me personally, I just haven't perfected it yet.

It stays in REALLY well. I can go swimming and much of it stays in. I need to take a shower and use shampoo to really get it all out. Sweating is no big deal at all. I play sports with it in all the time and no issues. For those losing hair, seriously, try it. It's so cheap, what's the risk?

Love it, will keep using it, I'm a huge fan."
212346,5,"Love this neon summer collection, and the name says a lot.  Peachy and light, perfect!"
394989,4,"Received it fairly quick, but not sure if it works...will know in a few months."
344145,5,"holds moisture well"
232920,5,"Thanks!"
360695,5,"brought this for myself and my daughter  tried it  loved it  I ended up buying her one"
334666,5,"What a great shave! I cry with joy every time I brush and drag my song and shaved face so gently! I cry tears of joy when I look in the mirror and see my face well formed! Hooray!"
489927,5,"I also got this with my Ipsy Bag and LOVED it ..and no break outs what so ever! Leaves my skin feeling so silky yet clean ..I had to find this!"
395943,5,"I love this product. It does exactly what it claims. I bought it to touch up my roots in between salon visits. I'm so impressed with it. It's easy to use (watch the video and another better video on QVC), doesn't feel like there's anything in your hair and it doesn't come out until you shampoo it out. The color match was perfect. It's not cheap, but considering how much professional color service costs, I think it's well worth it. I'm so impressed by this product."
234123,5,"I have used this sunscreen for some time (switching off with Davita) and have no complaints.  The product is a thin lotion and has to be shaken to blend the ingredients.
I have sensitive skin and have had skin cancer, and this lotion does not irritate my skin.  Because its SPF is 60, I feel I am getting the best protection.
There is no burning, little scent, it goes on smoothly, and I find there is no visible residue left after it dries."
257934,5,"Best stuff out there!!!"
204272,4,"A great product for moisturizing dry skin with the greasy effect. I use on my face and dry cracked heels. Useful and works well for both."
529381,2,"I love this product and have used it for years..this was my first time buying from Amazon. It seems to go on fine but it smells like lemongrass.  Not like my last tube that I bought from the manufacturer in June."
431548,4,"During the winter months my usually normal skin tends to dry out, plus the older I get the more moisturizing I need. Many of the products I've used to ""brighten"" my skin and minimize fine lines have the side effect of drying out my skin and causing it to get flaky and itchy, so I was happy to add the StriVectinLABS High Performance Booster Oil to my daily routine. After only a short period of time, I find it is already working well. Adding the oil gives my skin a soft, almost radiant, glow.

The product is packaged in a small bottle with a dropper that is used to apply the serum. It can be a little messy to use as there is no real control over the drops - it's best to get them to your face quickly so they don't spill. There is a pump on top, but that only seems to make the drops come out faster. The oil has a light fragrance - it's not bad but I can't place what it smells like - and after a half hour or so the scent disappears.

Two or three drops was enough to lightly cover my entire face. A small amount of the serum goes a long way. On top of that I added my regular moisturizer with sunscreen for daytime, and one with skin brighteners in the evening. When first applied it does feel a little greasy, but within a few minutes it was absorbed into my skin.

One annoyance, which in no way affects my rating of the product, but seems to be occuring with more and more packaging: The print on the bottle and on the leaflet in the box was so tiny I needed a magnifying glass to read it. When I finally did find the instructions it was only a few lines, and not much information. A little searching online told me what I needed to know to use the product correctly, but it would have been nice to have it in the box as that is the first place most people look for direction."
202432,4,"Great product but doesn't last very long before you have to buy another one."
69902,5,"I shave nearly everyday for work. I was looking for a new product that didn't break me out, or caused ingrown hair from pores clogging up. I was introduced to Jack Black years ago, and let's just say I've devoted to this line for the rest of my life. Get everything made by them because it is effective, and leaves your face smooth and fresh like fresh laundry out of the dryer."
209651,3,"First of all, let me say that Proraso is good quality stuff.  I gave this 3 stars because IMHO, it doesn't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes.  I have a tube of Proraso, but wanted to try this, and the razor glides much better with the cream and I get a much better shave.  Also, from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap, a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather, and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather.  I did this and it does work well, but that makes it a 2-step process which I don't want to do.  I'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush, then do the lather in a shaving bowl.  And for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream, it's kind of in-between.  It's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap, but it's definitely not a cream.  It's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand, put it back in the bowl, and you wouldn't need to wipe any residue off your hand."
568688,5,"Just as Described.....1oz.....Great Price!
Don't understand the negative feedback as it states 1oz multiple times in description.
This will be my 2nd order."
242022,5,"Naked Navet is the perfect combination of light pink and nude. Two coats and it is opaque unlike the sheer shades. I always get this nail polish at my salon because it lasts so long so I thought I'd try it out at home! Extremely easy to apply with minimal mistakes. Love it."
573497,2,"This was weird. It didn't mix well or go on smoothly and had an atrocious smell"
506438,5,"I used to have my nails professionally done for many years. They were very thin, brittle, would break split and peel. Since using this product my nails are growing strong, and long. They don't break, split or peel as much. I wear this all the time on my nails, reapplying a new coat twice a week and then putting other polish over top if desired."

415738,5,"favorite night cream."
261386,5,"I really like this light weight moisturizer. I've tried others but seem to always come back to this one. It's light weight but very moisturizing. I don't get burned after only applying it once in the morning and going for a hike. One little pump covers my face and neck. I have sensitive skin and this is great."
42209,1,"I have used this product every night for 8-10 weeks with no visible results. I use it around my eyes and if I read before bed it makes my eyes water."
330973,1,"sticky and VERY THICK. Weighed curls down, leaving NO bounce"
221193,5,"ABSOLUTELY LOVE LOVE LOVE this dryer. I have been eyeing it out for a while but was not wanting to pay $60 for a a hair dryer. Then after a few week of debate I decided to get it after all. It arrived yesterday and I could not wait and tried it on. OMG! This is the lightest BIG hair dryer I have ever owned. It feels GREAT in hand. Also 2000 watts is JUST what I needed for my thick, long and curly hair. Usually It takes me about an hour to blowdry and then another hour to straighten my hair but with this hair dryer I had nicely dried and styled my hair in 30 minutes! And the best part is I did not need to use a flat iron! My hair is super soft and I love how quickly I was able to accomplish what usually takes me almost to hours! I am in love and definitely highly recommend this dryer! It's worth every penny!"
571874,5,"Smells amazing"
53568,5,"Originally this package was stolen from my porch; however, Amazon refunded my money and sent me what I had originally ordered. I was so upset to see Lacoste discontinue this perfume, but I'm so pleased with how fast the item arrived and how well it was  protected so it didn't break in transit. I will definitely be ordering again!"
138117,5,"Great product"
218988,5,"Purchased on for my oldest daughter, loved it so much that when my blow dryer stopped I came back and ordered this one for me."
233358,5,"This is the only facial sunscreen I've found that doesn't break me out. I love it, and bought another bottle almost immediately to keep in my beach bag so it's always handy to reapply. Worth the money!"
11379,5,"My old reliable.  Quick delivery.  And makes me smell great (says my daughter)."
117777,5,"This is a must for those of you (like myself) who have gone to the single-edge safety-razor old-school technique.  You will get much more lubrication (that last for your entire shave) than you will with (fill-in-the-blank) commercial alcohol-based shaving gels.  If you take the time to hydrate your face with hot water, a very small amount of this cream will go a long way to ensuring you have a clean, comfortable, close shave with a safety razor relative to a commercial gel.  While the price per tube may seem expensive, in the long run, I think it's more cost-effective, and you'll get a better shave to boot."
51674,1,"I am 95% sure this is not the real product but some other serum instead, in a silk infusion bottle."
45914,5,"best straightner ever! Thank you babyliss! i have incredibly thick hair, so it takes me 2 hours at a salon to blow my hair out. this does the same thing in 20 minutes!"
313434,5,"Amazing"
221776,1,"I know any heat is damaging to the hair, however, this particular flat iron has completely damaged my hair. It does not leave it shiny or straight, it leaves my hair feeling like straw, coarse, brittle hair. I have used other hair straighteners in the past, but my hair has never been this damaged. I would love to return this product if I could. I have thick curly hair and can usually withstand a lot of heat, I have not changed any of my hair regimen other than the flat iron...Save your Hair, do not purchase."
188846,5,"If anyone is contemplating buying this product-no worries. It is miracle juice. Your hair loves it, makes it shiny and soft. Worth every penny. The only thing better is a keritan blow out at $200."
95288,5,"I have very thin and fine hair. My hair is also old and dull. This product puts life in my hair. My hair looks thicker and fuller as well as healthy and shines. I highly reccommend this product."

243085,5,"Love the color and how long it lasts!!!"
340327,5,"I usually don't write reviews because nothing works that well. I found this when I searched for products with azelaic acid in it, since I've been using it for years for mild breakouts here and there. I have tried a lot of products for pigmentation including dermatologist prescribed and bbl / ipl lasers which gave good results, but very expensive and didn't last. The lightening creams all seemed to clog my pores and not produce results.  I can honestly say this stuff starting working immediately, within a week!  I still have some red spots and freckles, it's. not magical, but way less than before and I've been using for about a month now.  Because of the azelaic acid, it is wonderful for my skin and I haven't had any breakouts since using this every day. I love it so much I bought my mom some to try and she says a few of her red spots she had are already flaking and peeling after one week of use!  Really great product! Can't say enough!"

120136,5,"This particular shampoo works great for my hair type, but was evidently discontinued by Paul Mitchell. I could not find it in any stores/salons. So, I went to Amazon, (of course) and found it. It's a big size so it will last a long time."

2007,1,"I've had KP since I was about 12 (I'm 28 now) and I recently tried KP Duty. I am absolutely *shocked* that a product that makes such brazen claims can be so ineffective.  The bottle actually has a cartoon CHICKEN on it, says it ""Effectively eliminates"" the bumps, and that ""Flawless"" skin is achievable.

  I have KP all over my legs; most of it is not inflamed, but there are a couple patches that are reddened.  I also have very fair skin (transparent, basically) and the KP looks bad enough that no one has seen my legs at all since I was 12.  (Insert complete social isolation and low self esteem HERE !)  So I was so happy to see that this ""KP Duty"" product was formulated specifically for this disease, and I really thought it would work.  Well, I've used it once a day for a month now and have noticed no reduction in the bumps or the red spots or the redness generally.  The skin does *feel* much softer, but it's as ugly as ever, and the bumps are obvious when you look at the skin in profile.

  I have no clue how long you're supposed to use this product before you see results.  They say you should try any new skin product for at least 6 weeks before you give up, so I think I will keep at it for a while longer.  But I'm assuming now that all of the raving reviews this product gets are due to its skin-softening effect, not ANY actual treatment of KP.  As Jay mentioned, any lotion can provide softer skin without the $35 price !!

  I have noticed within the past week or so that the ankle/calf region has started peeling.  I hope this is a good thing (exfoliation?) and maybe if it continues there could be some better skin revealed underneath.  However, so far even the peeling areas still have red, KP spots!

  Will post another review here if the product does turn out to be effective, but don't hold your breath, folks."
129797,5,"This product is amazing. It lasts forever, and it's 100 times more effective than using chapstick over and over."
452272,3,"I LOVE butter nail polish, but this is (1) hard to use; and (2) not super shiny. It was hard to get good coverage without being blotchy, and it started chipping after the first day, even on my toes, which is strange because usually my toe nail polish stays neat for roughly ten years, or whatever. It wasn't any shinier than my existing polishes (including my other butter colors), so I had to use two shiny top coats. It's a pretty color, but because it's such a light hue and so opaque, it shows flaws if you paint your own nails and aren't exactly Monet. I am not Monet, or even Picasso, so my nails looked ridiculous. On the upside, it's opaque, so you don't need one million coats even though it's a light color, so if you are a nail-superstar, you might be able to make this work better than me."
479677,5,"This is a product I have used for awhile and I love it. (It can be used heavy or light.) Price was the same I pay at salon, but the convenience of having it delivered to my home was wonderful. I love shopping on Amazon."

260335,5,"This product is the only one that helps keep my wrinkles at bay."
305838,5,"Love it"
415036,4,"Yes"
454538,4,"Good product. But does make hair stiff"
92593,5,"I love this stuff. It works great on your hair but I use it as a moisturizer on my skin also. Smells good and is non greasy."
254362,5,"My favorite eyeliner, hands down. Goes on smooth and even, water and smudge resistant, and the tube lasts for months with daily use."
222927,5,"I have very think hair and this works GREAT. Love the different heat settings and the wider  base"
125802,5,"Awesome stuff!  Great price!  Better than store prices."
384601,5,"This is the QUEEN of ALL highlighters! I've tried the more expensive ones, but doesn't compare to this beauty. At first I was hesitant since maybe it would be too light for my medium (nc44) skin color, but looks great. The brush that comes with it is really soft and does the job right. Highly recommend for daytime/ nighttime use."
93990,5,"This is the first product I've tried from Mario Badescu. I saw it recommended on another website to help with cystic acne, and in a moment of desperation I went ahead and ordered it. As an almost 30 year old woman, starting to develop acne for the first time in my life I feel so ugly and don't know how to deal with some of these really deep-set pimples.

This buffering lotion is not a miracle. It will not shrink your pimples over night as some people claim. It HAS, however, drastically cut down on the amount of time my cystic pimples stick around, and I will buy it 100 times over for that reason. It is a very runny consistency, it smells awful, and the directions say to only use it every other day - which is hard to stick to when you are absolutely desperate to get rid of a pimple. It's a wonderful product though, and I feel that it definitely lives up to what it says it will do for you!"
279966,5,"Love it!"
37417,4,"Nice clean feeling with moderate tingle. I still see some moderate breakouts, although I have very sensitive skin."
263005,5,"I love this stuff. I've used it on my 24"" hair, my short-short pixie-cut and everything in between. My hair is naturally curly and voluminous. It's a bit fine, so it can be fly-away. This stuff provides a little condition, good control and hold, very natural, nothing spiky or chunky. Silky to the touch, smells great and never leaves an untouchable-residue or stickiness. It works best on freshly cleaned hair, never weighs it down, and I can even use it 2-3 days in a row on re-dampened hair, without it getting heavy, sticky or gross."
528965,5,"Amazing! Leaves a nice cooling sensation on your lips. My only complaint is that it did break in half easily and the tube applicator isn't the best."
405311,2,"This did nothing for any of my dark spots.  I saw it recommended in a beauty magazine and thought I would give it a shot but it didn't work."
349392,5,"Went with the reviews on this one and I love it. Beware, use on lowest setting at first, it does get very hot!"
518731,3,"This is obviously used.  The compressor and all the parts came packaged in quart size ziploc bags and was dirty.  It does still work but I thought I was getting a new one.  Oh well, I saved $200 on this item."
478792,5,"I've been using this twice a day on a really bad case of cradle cap.  After only three applications I could see a noticeable difference and after a few days of use my baby's head was completely clear.  It also has a nice scent."
292315,5,"It's good for texturing when you don't want to wash your hair"
31380,3,"I am not impressed with this. It doesn't hold my hair all day. I probably will not buy this again."
416419,5,"Great stuff!"
33799,4,"4.5 stars

Have always been using crappy shaving cream. Didn't realize how much of a difference good shaving cream makes!
Smells amazing. Only downside is that it doesn't really lather very easily and if you don't spend time lathering, you tend to over-use it.."
438415,1,"Save your money and spend it on a better brand! Bought my in April & 3 months later one of the plates just stopped heating up (never dropped it, took really good care of it the whole time). What's the worst part is how their return/replacement policy works. Essentially, you are spending $100+ on the iron and they're asking you for MORE MONEY to fix a defective iron that you had no part in breaking. SKIP! Go get a Chi or LITERALLY anything else."
272317,5,"I use the curly girl method for curly hair and this is my shampoo and conditioner - i use it twice a week and it is fabulous"
418813,5,"I'll buy this stuff as long as they make it.  Great for medium length (2-4 inches) hair.  I wear my hair in a part and this stuff does a great job of keeping it in place, but still providing some volume.  It is also VERY easy to rinse out in the shower but does not sweat out at the gym."
383737,5,"A very straight forward shampoo. Great for thick hair!"
426710,5,"Great Product! My hair gets really tangled and this conditioner worked perfectly to untangle the mess! Highly recommend"

501869,5,"Use it almost daily!"
55389,1,"Waste of money. The pic of course make it look big. If you're in a hurry and miss the ounce....you end up with a Barbie doll size bottle. Never again."
385533,5,"I smelled this wonderful scent walking through the local mall and knew it would be $30 cheaper on Amazon! I bought this as surprise for my boyfriend and he will be very happy I got it for him! I wore it for an entire day to test it out and the scent stayed strong through the night, a little definitely goes a long way!"
143332,5,"This stuff is amazing. There's no other word for it. I purchased this because my skin has been completely going off the rails lately and my chin has been breaking out yet has been extremely dry, flaky, and has been peeling and irritated, almost like its chapped. It's been quite painful and I've used every oil, every moisturizer with healing/calming benefits I can get my hands on and nothing has worked to moisturize and calm my skin until this.

This spray smells amazing. It smells just like fresh roses. It is not oily or greasy, yet my skin drinks it in and has become softer, less irritated and the peeling and flakiness have completely subsided. My breakouts are reduced by half and are no longer painful and red. My skin is really starting to normalize and it's only been a day and a half! Everything I've used on my skin lately has stung except for this spray. I can't even begin to explain the relief I've experienced since my first spray.

This spray does not make your skin feel taught or dry after it dries like some setting/facial mists I have tried in the past. It leaves your skin plump, moisturized and comfortable.

I can't wait to continue using this spray and see what effects it continues to have on my skin and how it works with makeup. I haven't been able to wear makeup in the last few weeks because of my skin issue, and I'm going to wait a few more days to attempt it, but I'm anticipating a lot of good things.

This spray says once you try it you won't want to be without it...well, that couldn't be more accurate. This spray is one of the best skincare products I have found in recent memory and definitely worth the time and investment. Couldn't be happier and neither could me skin."
338416,4,"This BB has the best coverage of all I have tried. It is a little on the dark side, I could have used one shade lighter, but anyway for the summer my skin looks somewhat darker anyway. Also with a good SPF you don't need extra protection. A small quantity goes a long way and it is not heavy"
336825,1,"I got this and the glue was completely dried up. I ended up cutting open the tube just to see if there was anything useable inside and it was a yellow rubbery blob. I would STRONGLY advise you not to buy this online so you can make sure that you will actually get a useable product."
460040,5,"Love it!!"
253193,1,"I have gotten this item from beauty stores as well as through amazon before and have never had this problem. Maybe this was an individually defective item, however, from the time I opened it, it's been very dry. It is hard to apply as the felt tip is barely saturated with any of the actual liner. Used it for about a week, hoping it would eventually get darker and that maybe it took some time for it to work and at that point, didn't feel it would be appropriate to return. Very disappointing and I hope this was an isolated indecent."
356420,5,"This cream is very nice. Not too heavy. Definitely don't need to use much, which is always a plus. Helps reduce static too."

186771,4,"I love this product. It is a great bronzer that does not have the orange color that I find in many other bronzers. The reason for not giving this 5 stars is because when I received it in the mail today it was not packaged well at all and the mirror was broken."
123008,5,"Love it."
440023,5,"Great product! Prompt delivery!"
266095,5,"Pretty coral color. Great for spring and summer! Bottle looks orange but not true to nail color."
190457,5,"I love this blow dryer. I've literally had the same one for 2 years and it's MUCH quieter than other dryers I'm used to and it still works incredibly well. If mine every breaks I will definitely buy another Rusk dryer to replace!"
291752,5,"My favorite ""weekend makeup.""  It has a very delicate shimmer and makes my skin glow!  Covers like a beauty balm in a way.  Amazing product."
508215,5,"This is awesome love it on my skin"
51364,5,"I was looking for a facial scrub and usually, I'd find something on the cheaper side that just has something in it that would get the job done, but I was attracted to this one for its cooling properties and I wasn't disappointed.  I've never enjoyed a facial scrub more.  It leaves your skin feeling great and the scrub sand is the perfect size.  It's great how far a small amount goes."
316070,3,"Very pretty colors, I was just pretty disappointment when I opened it and the white, or ""sassy"", was cracked. But still a good product."
186538,5,"I love this powder.  It's neutral toned, no orange shade whatsoever.  Definitely use a lighter hand to apply, but you can build as needed.  Sometimes I use it to lightly contour my nose.  This is my second time purchasing...absolutely love it!"
529762,1,"I've been using this moroccan myrrh shaving cream and after shave for Years and i had never found such a good product which lets your skin so soft and hydrated after shaving everyday but their customer service is so so bad that it makes difficult acquire those products in decent conditions so i will have to change and try l'Occitane which looks similar. After having tried many channels like their webpage where they charge $10 for shipping (30% of the price of the product), i tried to buy it in Amazon but about 4 weeks having ordered it, i'm communicated there's no stock of product and order is cancelled!
Also i noticed a substantial decrease in quality recently. My last bottle of after shave was peeling and finished completely transparent after having let a bunch of flakes in my bathroom. Another customer mentioned he noticed a change in the formula and i would not be surprised as the scent does not last as much as i was used to."

526335,5,"Great rollers but hard to anchor in hair because they are heavy but the curls are great from rollers!"
534268,5,"I really love the tiny straw that directs the spray onto the gray areas without blowing all over my face. And it lasts until I wash my hair again. So...two days at least!"

Smells and feels good"

140495,5,"Definitely love the way this makes my skin feel. It feels like my face takes a deep breath when I mist it on. I've had it a couple of days, but I can say it is refreshing."
225496,3,"it was ok. its oil based so definitely be careful . i felt maybe i had a little bit more volume but not enough to justify the price."
19371,5,"Having long curly hair used to be a nightmare, but no longer!  This shampoo (and all the other products) are simply worth every penny!  My curls are more full, soft, and the frizz is gone.  Even on humid days, no frizz in sight!

As to the reviews about the smell, it doesn't smell bad. It actually smells like the wheat germ oil and honey shampoo I used to use years ago.  Plus, if you use other products, you can't even smell it.  Since the last thing to go into my hair is the botanical boost, that is what people smell.  And it smells really good.

I use this shampoo as well as the matching conditioner, mousse and the botanical boost.  No more fighting my unruly hair!  It's worth every penny!"

121719,5,"This smells amazing and does a great job of absorbing the oil in my hair. I don't like to wash my hair every day, so this stuff is great! I simply part my hair in various places and shake this in around the root and move on to the next spot. When I'm done, I rub it in with my finger and voila! Hair looks great!"
521764,5,"good"
255840,3,"ok product.  any of the dry shampoos leave a slight dull residue."

380380,4,"I really like this product.  It makes my dry hair look healthier and holds my style nicely.  better than ""10"" spray."
171290,5,"This was my first bottle of AHA/BHA cream that I have ever used. I love all SkinMedica products so I was excited to try this one. Besides the smell and a slight burn (SLIGHT) when applied, I am a huge fan of this! It brightens up my complexion and is nice to use at night before I go to sleep. I have not tried to apply this under makeup because it does have a slight sticky feeling to it for a bit. I only use this at night. Overall, I really like this product!"
445299,5,"Great for hair."
256558,1,"I read the description of the SensEpil in the Amazon add. It was expensive but worth it if it worked as advertised. When I received it, the instructions were not in English and the DVD would not load. I searched for instructions on-line and found this device would not work on light colored or grey hair. I returned it without ever plugging it in or removing it from the box.
It may very well work great for the type of hair described in the instructions. I will never know.

It has been one month since I mailed it back. Have not yet received confirmation that is was received let alone been given a refund. I'll never get back the shipping costs that could have been avoided if the advertisment had been clear."

Combined with the Ceremide capsules on a daily basis the routine is an unbeatable solution to bearing up under the ravages of time."
37730,3,"Results not exactly as expected. Only minimal improvement noted even though I use the product as recommended. Would probably not buy again for the price."
399769,1,"Not a great hand cream, very faint scent. I expected more from this brand. Very disappointed."

I would consider buying this again."

250695,5,"My lashes aren't the best. So-called curling mascaras don't do a thing for them. In an attempt to improve their appearance I have tried about a dozen different eyelash curlers. None works as well as this one. Its small profile allows me to apply just the right amount of pressure needed to curl my lashes effectively, without breakage or damage.

For an ""everyday"" curl, I apply the curler to the base of my lashes, release it, then ""walk"" it out to the ends of my lashes. Takes about a minute for each eye. For a ""dressier,"" longer-lasting curl I heat the pad with a hairdryer for about 10 seconds first.

Combined with your favorite mascara, this is a wonderful product for great lashes."
421773,5,"I've said it before and I will say it again- I am always absolutely amazed at the results I get from Lanza. I have baby fine hair and I'm usually hesitant to put oil based products in them because usually it weighs my hair down or makes it look oily. Not this. I could no believe how amazingly silky my bleached/processed hair felt after using this. When my current shampoo runs out, I plan to buy the shampoo and conditioner in this line."
220066,3,"This appliance is n ot terrible, but it's not as good as I had hoped it would be: This flat iron does not get quite hot enough...."
173291,5,"Love this stuff, I'm sad to see others not having the same great pre-shave experience that I get when using it. Like anything else in this genre, a little goes a long way. So if you find yourself using a whole bottle in a week, you're using too much!"
273477,5,"I have now purchased two of these in different sizes. This is the BEST curling iron I've even tried. What makes it so great is the finish--it's very smooth and slides easily, making a clean, frizz-free curl. I worry about damaging my hair with heated products but with this iron I'm able to only curl my hair for a few seconds at a time. AAAAMAZING device!"
280531,5,"Does what you need without all of the ""bad"" ingredients. Normal chap stick tends to make my lips even drier - but this stuff *rocks*"
344083,5,"Bought this as an extra with the system.  I knew that I would want another bottle of moisturizer.  I use a lot of moisturizer on my face and this one I really like because it doesn't have an odor. It seems to be working well."

103848,5,"I was a life long nail biter and nothing ever worked.  I chose fake tips for years to just stop the nasty habit.  After getting thinner nails from this process I asked the manicurist for another option and was turned onto this product.

58874,5,"I am a big time Kneipp bath product fan.  Their Eucalyptus formula leaves my skin tingly and the house smelling great!  It really helps minimize my families seasonal allergies and occasional colds discomfort too.  Before I found Kneipp I would use generic drugstore eucalyptus oil - the kind for humidifiers in my baths and at the sauna.  Kneipp Bath is WAY better and worth every penny."

252391,5,"I've been using this product for about a month now and I am so happy with the results!! I was losing hair because of crash diets and nothing I tried to reverse the hair loss actually worked so well as this product does. Initially, when I first used it, I noticed that the product plumped up my hair strands so it had the look of thick hair. Now a month later, my hair has significantly improved in hair thickness because of new hair growth and my hair also looks very healthy. I've also noticed that when I wash my hair I don't seem to be losing a lot of hair either.  Thank God for this product!"
301589,5,"I'm 73 now and I've been using this about 3 years every night !  First I put in on my neck and rub up wards plus I put some on my face too. My skin is very SOFT from using StriVectin-TL I LOVE IT IT REALLY WORKS

478414,5,"Holy moly guacamole!!! I was super unsure about a dry shampoo paste but since Amazon had a pretty kick ass return policy I gave it a go. I am really glad I did. A little goes a long way, so I know this will last a really long time for me.  A bonus since it is kind of spendy. I read some of the other reviews and one person recommended using this when you when your hair is wet. She was right, that is exactly what needs to be done. If I put this in when my hair is wet then style, it makes it so my hair doesn't need any more of this product or even shampoo for 4-5 days. I have pink hair and anyone who has crazy hair knows that every shampoo makes your color fade. So this is perfect for helping me keep my hair bright and fun."
275310,5,"This curling wand is wonderful.  Heats up quickly and the curls last!  I don't even use hairspray anymore.  I did a lot of reseach on different cermaic wands, and I'm glad I chose this one.  I really don't understand how so many reviewers are saying they burn themselves....it's really not that complicated. Just don't touch the hot part!!! :)"

320509,5,"Great product.  Very bad packaging by Amazon.  As many other reviews complain, the cap was broken in shipping.  It was included in a larger box with many items and didn't stand a chance.  It could have been avoided if Amazon wrapped it separately.

Very good product.  Love to use this stuff when removing makeup."
405136,5,"Love this scent! Arrived beautifully!  5 stars all the way :D"
571812,5,"Works best when applying to my hair 15 minutes after hopping out of the shower, while my hair is still wet. Typically flip my hair to gain volume and touch up with some cream when my hair dries if its still frizzy. Dont need much. About as much as my thumb top knuckle. Love it."

548459,5,"My daughter is a fan of this brand of makeup, she prefers it over most brands.  The colors go on as they appear in the photo without needing to use large amounts.  They are not greasy feeling, and clean off easily with normal makeup removers.  The price is rather high compared to most brands though.  A little does go a long way with these colors, and especially this brand since not as much is required when compared to others."

This curling iron is amazing! It heats up quickly and evenly, which is so important. It is longer than any of my cheap irons and I love that! Mt curls look gorgeous and hold all day. Not to mention that you can change the heat dial to give you different looks on any given day. This is a quality product that I would absolutely purchase again in the future."

I can't put it in my purse to use on the go because the lid won't stay on and the stain will get all over the inside of my purse.  I learned this from experience.  I hope the lid isn't designed to be this loose because it isn't much use if I can't take it with me."

248276,5,"Light weight and smells amazing. I straightened my fine curls and with the Agadir Mousse and OGX Keratin flat iron. After blowing drying and flat ironing, I sprayed my hair (3 pumps) with this oil, lightly, and it looked amazing. Tomorrow is suppose to be humid. I cannot wait to see how my hair will react."
313997,5,"This is my favorite brand of nail lacquer. It is the best quality around and this seller was well priced. This is a very sparkly holiday color and I will use it when I want to celebrate anything. It arrived quickly and was packaged well. This was a great seller and I am a very happy buyer."
76205,5,"Before I ordered from you, I went to several local stores, no noe carry it. I am very satisfied with the quality of the blades. Thanks a lot."
274540,4,"This long handle safety razor was well made and worked well. It replaced an older Gillette from the 60's."
573825,4,"My wife loves this gel-like product. This product feels light to the skin and non-greasy and absorbs almost immediately. After a couple of weeks of consistent use, my wife exclaims that this is such as super awesome product for her skin as she says that her fine lines are not visible anymore. Only complain is that the container - pump side falls apart quite easily."
325213,5,"This comb is attractive and has a nice weight and shape to it.  Only you can decide if it's worth the price over a drugstore comb, but the main differences are (1) weight (2) how finely rounded the edges are.

The comb feels substantial and it's size makes it easy to grip.  Any comb will probably do the job of getting out tangles, but the tines of this comb feel smoother on the scalp and has a nicer weight to it than comparably-sized combs that are less expensive.

The acetate material will become slightly cloudy from combing action (hair being pulled along the frame will cause fine scratches that remove some of the out-of-the-box shine), but it doesn't affect the generally attractive tortoiseshell appearance.

Another thing to note is that I have owned a similar comb by a British company (Kent Brushes), and cellulose acetate is no more durable (in fact, it may even be more brittle) than harder plastics.

Overall, I recommend this comb, but I'm sure it's worth the sticker price.

Edited to add: I've had this comb for over a year and it still looks and works great.  Prefer it to other combs I've had and thus for durability I'm upgrading it to 5 stars (instead of the 4 stars in my original review)."
111901,5,"love these~!"
93471,5,"This stuff works!

I'm 33 with extremely oily, sensitive skin. I have cystic acne too. I've tried everything you can think of to deal with my acne and nothing has worked. I react badly to salicylic acid so I steer clear of those products. I found this stuff and decided to give it a try.

I had broken out badly on my jawline and chin about a week ago. I applied a thick layer of this powder on top of the problem areas every day for five days straight. My skin looks so much better! It takes out the redness and dries the acne up without drying out my skin.

Definitely a must have for people with difficult skin."
367997,5,"I ready love this eyebrow pencil, color is great not to dark or light, it doesn't break off of smudge and last all day"
92516,1,"The product arrived and it had been cracked and broken!  The product was all over everything, not enough in the bottle to even send back!
Horrible packaging for this specific product!"
286677,5,"This is my favorite moisturizer.  It feels so natural, never greasy.  I love the very light clean scent."
204189,5,"I haven't found another eye product on the market that can compare to this.  Perhaps the title misleads.  I'm 86 and have been using this for at least ten years.  I have never expected this to ""lift"" anything, but as a superb moisturizer for skin around the eyes, it's soothing, gentle, non-irritating and has kept that area moist and fresh-looking."
430671,4,"This is really good for hiding bruises or other marks. Riding and working with horses daily leaves me random bruises all the time - especially on my legs. This is a problem if I need/want to wear a skirt or dress. I have to decide between pantyhose or attempting to cover the bruise or just wearing pants.

This camo medium coverage actually did a good job covering a fresh bruise on my thigh. I bumped into a rock trying to clear a trail by the creek this morning. The resulting scratch and dark area is seriously ugly. One thin layer covered and hid 90% of the discoloration. Unfortunately, the copper color is a tad too dark for my skin tone, but I am perfectly willing to find the correct shade for future use."
38231,1,"To me personally it just feels too heavy on my skin.  It still settles in the wrinkles the same as a liquid or cream foundation."
423891,5,"As an active 36 year old male that teaches 11th grade history and enjoys playing basketball and lifting weights, I was very impressed with this product.  The stick deodorant, Lacoste Live, provided enough dry protection that my usual deodorant did.  A deodorant that I have used for the past 15 years.  I did really enjoy how the stick was not as moist as some deodorants were and how compact it was.  The 75 ml size is perfect for traveling and it only takes one swipe of the round shaped stick for enough protection for a very busy day.  The smell is not overpowering but just enough to mask over any odor that a man leaves behind."
80406,5,"Great Product !"
264706,5,"not cheap but it has the chemicals to keep me looking young and not like an old coach bag!"
129342,5,"5 stars"
289971,5,"i will have ti use the item more than three tims to  see any results. however, at the preset time I am satisfied with it.  ms. Brown"
457386,4,"It's a good conditioner, it definitely made my hair softer and easier to manage.  I love the smell, and I love being able to run my hands through my hair and have my aging, color-treated, daily blow-dried hair feel SOFT. Even the next morning, before I wash my hair again, I can still feel the softness, it's long lasting.

My only quibble is with the packaging. This particular pump is short to the base, and does not dispense much product. And I found I needed a lot of product to get full coverage.  I found myself having to get 4-5 pumps to cover my shoulder length hair.  A pump that dispenses more would have been more useful. And the pump being so close to the base also seems to make it a little stiffer, it's not as easy to pump as other products I have.

But other than the pump, this is a nice conditioner. Recommended."
24864,5,"Does what it's supposed to do and even has a sticky strip on the side so you can stick it on the wall."
262135,5,"Great product. No eye burn, stays on pretty well. Easy on the skin and I don't smell like some tropical dessert."
298887,5,"Jury is still out on this one"
1166,5,"Works great!!!  This is the best product ever!!!  I absolutely love it!!!  I recommend it to all who want white teeth!"
391412,5,"Just in love with the rose smell. Will buy again!"
444139,3,"Have you ever smelled peach ring gummy candy? This hand cream smells exactly like that candy. The package is fun and the scent is strong but wears off pretty fast."
134545,5,"I purchased this flat iron about 5 years ago & it died this week. I couldn't find it locally and am thrilled to find it online! I use it everyday, it's the perfect size. The comb is a handy feature to ensure a smooth polished look."
519361,5,"This stuff smells incredible"
175885,5,"Best moisturizer I have ever used."
490788,5,"Love this shadow!"
51549,5,"I've used Potion 9 for years. I have fine hair, but it's pretty long and gets tangled even just out of the shower. I let my hair dry for a while, then I put some Potion 9 and brush my hair out easily. You can also put it on already dry hair, or when you get out of a pool and it detangles well.

I like the packaging of this better than the old tube. No accidentally squirting way too much out and wasting it. I'll definitely continue buying this."
155297,4,"I have used this product a few times since I am trying to wash my curly hair less. Allow me some hope that my hair won't dry out as fast.  The smell is pretty lemony - but not so bad that I would stop putting it in my hair.  Obviously, since it is a powder, it does make your roots a little white, but just keep massaging and you should be fine.  I watched a tutorial on Youtube about sectioning the hair, and it worked out pretty well.

I have not used another dry shampoo, so I can't comment on if it's better or worse then others - but, I have liked the results so far.  Allows me one more day without washing my curly hair!"
138024,5,"Really helps my rosacea when I use with the other Pevonia products for rosacea."
533564,5,"Great - keeps my hair smooth but not oily. Love the smell. Lightweight feel."
123892,4,"It's slim and sharp, easy to hold and use.  I ordered the blonde color, but it really is a little dark.  I just apply it with a lighter hand.  I would buy again."
281866,5,"Gorgeous color, CND is the best brand of gel polish out there."

79713,1,"i wanted to help my curly hair to be more manageable but after seeing so many awful reviews i feared the worst so I have it right there under my bathroom sink accumulating dust..."
124263,5,"I just love this product. I tried it with Ipsysome months ago and couldn't resiste to buy one. In their shop, it would've cost me aroung 100$ because ofthe freaking shipping. Now I've save like 40 or 50$! And it's the same thing. Thanks Amazon! And, for the lotion it self, it has a cool sensation on the skin after you apply it and it makes your skin soft for the rest of the day. You can use it before your whole day or after to relax a little. Altought I think the price is high for this quantity."
244683,5,"Received my order and was surprised at the quantity for the value when so many other products charge just as much for a sample size. Loved the smell of the product! Only used it as a moisturizer so far but left my skin feeling very soft! Highly recommend!"
203648,5,"Fast shipment good quality"
204085,4,"This is some pretty good soap. It will get the job done and make your skin feel smooth as the head of a snare drum and about as tight. Best to grab a non alchohol based moisturizer or, this works for me a bit, some body powder like gold bond. And be warned you will need to get this soap good and wet or else the residue will cake up on the blade."
85048,1,"This tasted SO BAD!!!! I barely tasted the bubble gum. Yuck!"
559489,5,"It is light weights little goes a long way. You can actually feel it tingle when you apply it. I tried it on my 87 yr. old mom and she loved it too! I I used to buy some very high end products at neiman marcus  and these products work just as well if not better."
106409,5,"I really like this applicator now that I have a handle on how to use it.  At first I found myself feeling it was hopelessly clogged and had to be routinely replaced. However, I've learned a few things over time and through trial & error. 1) Use the smallest size Toppik container. Even though this sprayer will work with either 12 g or 27.5 g container size, it doesn't work well when the product is too low in the container - that is, when the top of the product is more than an inch from the top of the container. For this reason, I suggest strongly that you use it on the 12 g container.  I buy the 27.5 g container, and I use that to refill the 12 g container. This applicator works like a suction and it won't be able to suck up the fibers if they are too far from the top. Keep it more than half full and shake while using to keep things flowing. 2) Can the applicator clog? Sure it can - but in my experience this isn't what's keeping it from working. However, if you're unsure then remove the applicator from the product container and immerse it in water and see if you are able to pump water through it. If so, then the water either resolved the clog or there was never a clog and you're probably experiencing a problem with the product being too low in the container. After you wet it, pump out all the water and put the applicator aside to allow it to dry before you attempt to use it. The spray applicator shouldn't be used while it's wet because then it will definitely clog. 3) Sometimes you just have to use the original product as a shaker. The spray applicator isn't the best to use for every situation, so your overall results will be best if you keep a shaker cap on hand so you have this option open."
320407,5,"Very good for sensitive skin and this is coming from someone who usually has trouble with sensitive skin products that are on the market. It's a very good makeup remover the only thing is that it will take extra effort to remove long lasting liquid lipsticks.

I also use it to sometimes to remove dirt and grime right before washing my face on days that I am makeup free."
454060,5,"This stuff works like the hairspray you remember from 1985 without the weird shine. Great for up-dos or catching strays from a pony tail. It actually dulls the hair if you overuse it... and you don't need much at all. I like the smell. It's strong and some people don't, but people compliment me on it all the time."
158419,5,"i am currently almost 40 weeks pregnant, and what i call myself a chronic hand-washer; constantly meeting with people, working in an office environment and moving about. I have tried so many creams and lotions for my hands and find that they aren't thick enough, or are thick but get greasy and you can tell where i have been by the finger prints i leave behind! this is an excellent cream that does have a camphor smell for about 30 seconds, but its incredibly smooth, non greasy, and i feel like when i wash my hands so frequently, it soaks in so quickly, that i don't wash it off entirely. it creates a ""barrier"" almost. i'd definitely recommend this cream to anyone who has moderate to severely dry hands, feet, elbows, lips, etc. i love it!!"
388106,5,"I used to go to a salon for lash extensions monthly.  For the price of one visit, GrandeLASH allows me to have 3 months of lash growth.  I also pair it with the mascara, which is also good stuff."

154527,5,"Very good"
139131,5,"Im a lotion junkie who also has a mercury allergy. I have no issues with this lotion! It goes on a little heavier than a light lotion, like Jergins for example. It does remain on the hands for a little bit. The scent is like that GOOD unrecognizable scent your grandma wears. I use this before bed and there was a very light but on my skin in the am."
547908,5,"Use to sell these products in my line of work, great product as always!"

1791,1,"Terrible! Doesn't do anything near straighten. Just pull n frizzes."
463284,5,"It's such an amazing liquid lipstick, I'm in love with it. You just have to apply it once and it will be with you all night long."
537563,5,"I use this only on the face.  No burns so far.  Goes on super smooth and soft.  A couple acne breakouts in the beginning but after that, no problems.  Last a while too.  I would get 3 1.5 oz bottles instead of 4.5 oz so you can have one at work, home, and on the go."
476953,4,"It's a bit hard to completely blend it into my skin. I assume it's doing its job, since I am outside for at least 30 minutes 5+ times a week and haven't received any ""raccoon"" tan lines from my glasses!"

302858,5,"This is a famyastic product. The ladies of the house really enjoy this item. The price and size are great. I will be getting more for other family members for next christma and birthday presents."
124439,3,"Product should have better packaging because all the liquid required to keep the pads wet had leaked out during shipping.  The products does work very well as described."
266620,2,"The first time I used this the polish went on perfectly smooth, no lumps.  The second time I used it the color went on all lumpy and gloppy...I hated it so much I took the polish off right then and redid my nails cuz I thought I had done something wrong.  Nope, came out all lumpy & gloppy again.  I read some other reviews where this happened to other people.  I threw the bottle out then.  So I got one good manicure out of it.  Pretty expensive manicure!"
225308,5,"worth the $$$$$  I tried so many others... i give up - sticking with this!"
488055,1,"Inconsistent. Received recent bottle and the clay was soft and creamy, whereas past two bottles were more firm. Not sure if it was defective or change of formula?"

5306,5,"very pretty"
562537,5,"Delivery was on time. I can't rate the product since it is a gift for Christmas. My granddaughter raved about a sample she received and I expect she will not be disappointed."
76521,5,"I like them."
404898,5,"I love this face wash!! I used this for my entire pregnancy after breaking out in the beginning. My skin had been clear before pregnancy and then went somewhat crazy. It cleared my skin up and it remained healthy for the remainder. I'm still using it after baby and still loving the results. Another awesome product from MamaMio!!!"
550219,2,"This is the third brush I've received on auto order, and each has been challenging to insert and remove from the Clarisonic Mia 3. Twenty percent of the time there is no ""Sonic"" action, and the latest brush will not detach. I have no idea whether the problem is with the supplier (i.e., counterfeit?) or Clarisonic (quality). The brushes appear to be name-brand replacement parts."
442077,5,"Love the size with the pump and it smells amazing!!"
141705,5,"I absolutely love this stuff. It's small enough that I can throw it in my purse and use it on the go. I even use it for a setting spray at times."
181554,5,"I love the heat settings, I have not had to turn it up very high. My last curler I turned all the way up and was holding my curls for over 30 seconds and getting so-so results. This one I use on 3 and hold for 10-15 seconds and have great curls! I also love the rotating cord, it makes it very easy to maneuver this curler. I am very glad I bought it."
253309,5,"Best liquid liner!!!! I have tried many other brands and this one is by far the smoothest and stays on all day!"
428611,5,"Nice and lite.  Love it."
248953,5,"I have very thick, 100% Italian wavy hair and this product calms it down and leaves luxurious shiny waves.  Highly recommend this product if you have ""ethnic"" hair."
510819,5,"My mom got me started on this product and I am hooked!  My face is so much clearer and softer.  Would highly recommend.  My face broke out slightly for two weeks while it cleared out the impurities.  Since then, it is very rare to see any acne and my rosacea has gotten so much lighter I can now go with little to no make up.  I LOVE this product!"
544471,5,"great way to try more products without commitment of a big bottle. I love the Mio line"
474146,5,"I love this conditioner. It is not heavy and does not leave a residue. I have thin, fine hair. My hair looks better with this light weight conditioner."
303012,4,"I love vanilla scents, and this Comptoir Sud Pacifique had great reviews so I decided to give it a try. I'll admit, at first I was not sure about this one. It goes on strong, and when I first spritzed it I got the dreaded ""Play Doh"" notes that other reviewers have mentioned. However, after a few subsequent uses, the smell seemed to shift for me and has since settled into smelling sweet and sugary, like fresh vanilla frosting or toasted marshmallows -- in fact, on separate occasions, I have had coworkers say I smelled like both of these. It's delicious! I now look forward to putting it on every day. The scent also has pretty decent lasting power (I still get whiffs by the end of the day) and mixes well with other sweet smells -- it has layered well when I tried it with vanilla and coconut lotions.

I think the sweetness of the fragrance might be a little too cloying for warmer months, but it's really nice for fall and winter. I'm glad I gave it a try!"
23286,5,"EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!! I had a hair transplant May 16, 2014 and this product adds a great deal of thickness to the fine hairs in my bald spot, all of the hairs look as if  they are coming out of my scalp.  Absolutely, nobody knows my secret :-)"
228975,4,"It's a well-made razor, but if I had to do it again, I'd get a longer handle.
Mostly, I'd like to add my comments to those that talk about the difference between a multi-blade cartridge razor and this safety razor. These guys had me a little intimidated the first time I used this thing: all this stuff about the best shaving soaps, the ritual, the extra time, and especially about shaving with the grain of your beard.
My response is two words: shower shave.
It's what I've always done, and I've always finished my shave against the grain. I use plain soap on my face towards the end of my shower, and just shave.
The only difference between my old shaving routine with a cartridge razor and now with this double-edge one is that I don't feel ripped off when I buy blades. And that's good.
Actually, there is one other difference - this thing feels old-school and manly."
314935,5,"Super pigmented and came in one piece! I was hesitant to open the bronzer because I realized it was not wrapped in any bubble wrapping or protection of any sort. I love it! Can't wait to use it!!"
428629,2,"This is a great product. It is the only products that's ever help me. The key, as with all products, You have to be diligent. A little pricey, but for me, it's a must."
342069,5,"So cool! I'm getting these for everyone for Xmas. Great packaging, product works really well. Really cool design. I was worried about getting my perfume in the bullet but I basically just kept a pumping the perfume into the funnel and it took about 2 minutes"
547865,2,"Too greasy. Can't get it off my hands or out of my hair."
537262,5,"Ive finally found a great relaxer that actually straightens my hair without frying it. I have extremely thick, coarse hair and my hair often doesnt straighten easily. I decided to go natural and that didn't go so well. I followed the instructions and experienced no burning. I did have to wash my hair 4xs because it took awhile for the shampoo to turn completely white. Outside of that, my hair is now bone straight, soft, and manageable. Its expensive but absolutely worth it."
346219,5,"great"

220797,5,"I love this. It dries my hair so much faster than my old dryer. Great heat and power."
34877,5,"I use this once a week on my 2 years old hair to stave off cradle crap. She would get it when a baby and if I don't use mustela. Love this and it smells light and warm."
355466,5,"Saw this color featured in several magazines, and was happy to see it available here. The color is a vibrant glazed deep pinky purple that goes with so many fall and winter colors. Stunning with grays, jewel tones, and a real pop with black. I like Essie because it stays on nicely without chipping. Essie always has the perfect updated colors. This color will look great with whatever you wear this winter (The Lace is On).
  Also bought another 2013 color, Vested Interest. This is a lovely matte color, a greenish gray, that also goes great with tweeds and other fall colors. Love the slightly edgy vibe, but super wearable, and looks fabulous on short nails."
321868,2,"I was interested in this product because it says ""for all hair types"" and I wondered if it would make my medium fine hair more under control and healthier looking especially during muggy, windy or very dry days.  the oil has a scent that is pleasant but a little too strong for me.  I put it on very conservatively as directed, blow dried my hair as usual and my hair looked limp (but shiny!).  My guess is this would work well for curly, coarse, or maybe even thick straight hair.  It is just not for fine and straight.
."
396676,5,"I've tried many cover up products and this is the best. It clings to the hair, doesn't flake off and stays put. And if it rains you don't have to worry about it coming off. With other products you have to reapply the next but I have to reapply very little with this. It never feels tacky like some of those mascara types. I gave it to a friend and she loves it too. She agrees that this is the best product she's used. The price is a little steep but a little goes a long way. I'm still using the same one that I purchased 6 months months ago."
86967,5,"Great color. My girl friend loves it."
234136,3,"I really wanted to love this sunscreen because it feels very light going on, and did not make me oily (I have dark, combination oily skin).  Unfortunately, after I rubbed it in and thought it looked great, I went outside and my husband said ""your face looks a little white..."" Darn!!  Oh well, I use it now at the beach (when I don't care about a tiny white tint sometimes) or on other parts of my body where the white tint isn't as important/noticeable.  Keep looking, grail-seekers!"

93183,5,"This stuff is awesome! My second daughter was born with BAD baby acne. It made me so sad to see her sweet little face covered in acne. It was the worst on her cheeks, but it was also on her nose, chin, neck, and forehead. After about 7-10 days of using this twice a day (morning and night), her skin was perfectly clear and baby smooth!

Sometimes she'll still have a little blemish pop up during the day, but this takes care of it in a few hours. It smells awesome and has been super gentle on her skin."

144903,5,"Perfect curling iron!! And perfect for my budget!"

between coloring hair so it makes healthier hair possible."
343160,5,"This is the best foundation I have every used.  It is light but fully covers the discolorations on my skin.  I looks smooth, perfect color, and it looks like I have good skin, not make up covering my skin.  The color was exactly like on their color swatches online and suits my skin perfectly.  Highly recommended."

378558,2,"The good: It smells AMAZING. I received a sample of this shampoo & conditioner with another purchase, and couldn't believe how intoxicating the scent is, without inducing headache. The smell even lingers in my bathroom for hours! The bad: I've tried the conditioner on 3 occasions now, and found it nothing but frustrating. It disappears - and not in a good way. Even a generous handful can't be felt after applying it to wet hair, and the result leaves my long, fine hair knotted and difficult to detangle after rinsing. With how gloriously silky the shampoo is, I had high hopes for the conditioner. Unfortunately, it doesn't do the trick for me. I had to pull out my $6 drugstore conditioner to try and rescue my hair after the 3rd go-round with this stuff. Disappointing, as I already ordered a set of the shampoo and conditioner after the first use, because I loved the smell so much. Oops! Well, live and learn."

256222,3,"As someone who tries to live a life without harsh chemicals, who buys Earth-friendly products, who recycles and does her part, I thought this would be ideal.  Eucalyptus?  Heck yeah!  Non-toxic?  You know it!  Cool packaging?  I'm sold.  Upon application, this stuff smells fantastic, but the scent dissipates so I don't smell like a ""spring breeze"" all day long (honestly, deodorant purveyors, no one can possibly want to smell the way you think we all do).  And for a few days during the winter, this was the perfect deodorant.  Sitting still at my desk in a climate-controlled environment, this stuff worked like a dream.  Eventually, spring arrived and I started moving around a bit and it didn't seem to be as great as I once thought.  And now it's summer and (Malin + Goetz), I gotta tell you, the magic is completely gone.  Perhaps if I kept one with me at all times it would be okay, but I think that might be a little bit more than I'm willing to commit for underarm purity.  So, I still use it on days when I know I'll be stuck at my desk for 10 hours straight, but I revert to another mass-market product on days when I'm traveling or when it's forecasted to be over 40 degrees Fahrenheit or I have to be around other people at all in any capacity.  So, all of you Amazon shoppers who are required to sit perfectly still all day or whose jobs involve exposure to constant refrigeration and zero stress, this is the deodorant for you!  For the rest of us, I'll keep looking around."

219552,5,"My stylist recommended this dryer to me as this is the one she uses.  I have used it about three times and it seems to dry my hair faster. I can get my wavy, curly hair fairly straight with just using a round brush. Love the long cord and its light weight! I would recommend this dryer and the price is not bad! I accidentally turned it off a few times the first time I used it but I am getting used to the dryer now and that hasn't happened lately."

440624,5,"I love this curler.  I have slightly wavy, just below the shoulder thick hair and a lot of it.  Using the Miracurl Steamtech it took about 30 minutes to do my entire head but the curls stayed all day, I got so many compliments on how great my hair looked.  The curls were even there the following morning.  The system couldn't be easier to use, just put a small amount of hair between the clamps of the appliance, close clamps and wait for the beeps, open up and you have your curl.  I have used many curling irons in the past and think this is probably the best and easiest to use ever.  Would definitely recommend."

562507,2,"Does  not get the job done."
565454,2,"Not practical - it has a button to turn in and off that I often accidentally press, during it off while in use.
It also burns my hair - heat is hard to control and even one second can fry it. Many times strangers have said is smells like burned hair when I walk by.
Dont buy - the return window is very short. I am now stuck with a $260 curler that Ill never use."

257930,5,"Great CND product! Very moisturizing with easy application. Goes on via brush, like polish."
370923,5,"This stuff is recommended on the Curology website. I use Curology and my formula contains tretinoin so I needed a good SPF. Before I had been using Physicians Formula CC cream. However the PF CC cream contains pore clogging ingredients. MDSolarSciences on the other hand, when it comes to pore clogging ingredients, passes with FLYING colors on the CosDNA website! It does not offer as much coverage as a CC cream or foundation would, but it does offer a light tint and helps with complexion. The light tint it has blends in really well. When I first started using it I hadnt been in the sun in ages (for fear of sun damage if I didn't wear any SPF, and for fear of breakouts if I did). So my skin was really light and this wasn't too dark at all for me. Since Ive been using it Ive felt more comfortable spending time outdoors in the sun so my skin has gotten a little darker, and it still blends effortlessly. It does not clog my pores. It goes on smooth. It doesnt rub off and leave residue on clothes or anything. You cant tell you're wearing it. Its just amazing! I only wear this and then cover any pimples or hyperpigmentation with Almay Skin Clearing concealer (however I rarely get pimples these days!). Yes its a little pricey but honestly I think its totally worth the price."
524577,1,"One star for the price. Yes Rainbow connection was a limited edition polish and it is now discontinued and hard to find but do not pay $30 for it. Don't pay anything over $9 for it. OPI re-released a few of their discontinued glitters this spring, including Rainbow Connection under the name ""Chasing Rainbows."" If you missed out on Rainbow connection, buy Chasing Rainbows for $9 retail. It is an exact duplicate."
444499,1,"This is a disappointment .  The auto wind feature is nice, but it doesn't do anything my InStyler can't do  and it doesn't do it as well.  Hair doesn't come out as smooth and, worse, it leaves the ends with weird, matted bits. I wanted to give it a shot so I tried it a few times and now I've missed the return window.  Otherwise, it would go back."
322093,5,"Keeps my over processed hair in great shape!"
506824,1,"The product arrived with a damaged lotion bottle.  Lotion covered the entire product.  I called the company the next business day.  They were apologetic, and said they were going to send another kit to replace the damaged one within 7-10 business days.  It has been over a month with no new kit.  I have not been able to get in touch with them since."
94645,5,"OK."

Maybe it's my hair type that was not in accordance with the product..."
279894,5,"this is the only thing that agrees with my skin. my skin is very sensitive. this product minimises my bumps to nonexistance. im still not sure what causes my break out but this product keeps me from popping them."
181979,5,"I use before and after styling.. I have alot of thick course hair and this helps me keep a polished look"
205159,5,"My skin has recently started getting blemishes on a regular basis.  This is rather frustrating when you hit your mid-late 30s.  Now I've never had a facial skin care routine beyond facial wash (nivea & neutrogena products).  Realizing the old way wasn't working anymore I opted to buy this along with Jack Black facial wash & moisturizer and couldn't be happier.  This really is a miracle worker.

My skin still has issues particularly after shaving but I apply the mask for 20min at night and the following morning my skin is much improved.  Vast majority of blemishes are gone and what is left is greatly reduced and no longer red.  It will dry your skin out but that is probably part of the process.  Just use high quality moisturizer and you will have no issues.

It is pricy but no pricier than a bottle of decent wine or a couple lunches out.  I figure $25 every other month is a small investment for greatly improved facial skin."
282621,5,"On of my favorite colors."
454803,4,"Works great just have to remember to remove it when you go to bed so it doesn't get on your bed"
524047,5,"I'm allergic to every other eye cream I've ever tried - this one does the job very well!"

494868,4,"Great product but the product was delivered with no plastic seal.  I didn't return this time but will next time if no seal."
319528,4,"I love this body wash. I only wish it came in a bigger size and wasn't so expensive."
1651,5,"Great cologne - I always get compliments on how great it smells! The smell lasts as long as I'd like it to (which is about half the day)."
480670,3,"Maybe there was a bad batch or the one i received was old?  I had this in my ipsy bag and it was great so I ordered it. What I got is what others say - clumpy and goopy and hard to put on cleanly like the one in my ipsy bag. Not worth the hassle to try to return so I'll make it work but I can't see myself buying it again."
183900,5,"This little bottle really works. My favorite treatment for occasional acne. Don't shake the bottle - the application is unique in that you dip a cotton swab through both the liquid and the solid. Then dab on your face and it helps clear zits much faster."
316490,4,"I totally got sucked into the fun and gorgeous packaging of this product.  The colors are great and versatile, especially for office looks.  Since I have so many eye shadows, and in similar colors, I liked the amount of shadows in this palette.  It totally justified the purchase for me."

Although I rate both products as excellent, I find Arko shave stick to be slightly better in its lathering ability, workability and fun factor!"
418672,5,"Reuzel red works great for a water based pomade, the hold and shine are great. The smell is really nice too."

317,5,"I'm gardening 3-4 days a week. Push mower, weeding, trimming, planting... I don't like to wear gloves and my hands look and feel like they belong to a corpse, buried for 2 weeks. I put this creme on 2 hours before I make dinner and a second application as we sit down for dinner. My husband can't tell if I've been working in dirt all day. I'll use it 2-3 times a day during winter to combat the dryness. I love the soothing scent and the 'invisible glove' feeling it gives me."
236003,5,"Was sent the weong stuff twice. I wanted the cold cream in the chapstick tube. It's a favorite and been using it for years.. Twice I got the slime in a squeeze tube.

445657,3,"Is not as spectacular as expected. I didn't feel major improvements. It's good, but that's it."
381790,5,"This product is a lifesaver. It took a minute to get used to using it, but I use mine to make waves as my hair is naturally pin straight. I can't go anywhere without it now! It heats up so fast as well. The cord is nice and long and it has all the settings i need for my shorter bob cut and straight/fine hair."
291405,4,"Like the shave gel better  without  the hot towel.
The hot towel  treatment  caused my razor to drag and clog.
Did little  to soften  my beard.
The other stuff is fine including  the after shave treatment."
411037,5,"It came in perfect condition, packaging is even better looking in person, I think my teenage daughter will love it!!"
111620,5,"I replaced Mary Kay's Tinted Moisturizer with this after switching all my beauty and hygiene products to all-natural. I like it. It has good coverage, contains moisturizer and SPF, no different than the previous product I used except this is a healthier option. I use a pea-size every day and it has lasted me about 4 months now."
16391,5,"I love this size. Don't expect this size to give your curl.  It will quickly tame frizz and straighten and add volume and a small wave. Easier than flat iron and your hair will not be stick straight. Perfect!"
368520,5,"I love this! My vacation was ruined (ok slight exaggeration but I was honestly bummed) when I accidentally packed it in my carry-on instead of my luggage and it got taken tossed out in the security line. It made my hair softer with just a few sprays without feeling oily or with noticeable buildup. There's no strong smell though - there's a slight scent when you first put it on, but by the time you're done and outside, it's not noticeable at all. I like to use this on my hair when I have it down; it makes my hair feel soft and shiny and frizz-less. It's light enough that it didn't even bother me when I slept on my pillows with it a few times (I only use about 3-5 sprays)."
443437,4,"I like the product but every time I order it several ounces are lost because of how it is shipped!  Who ever ships the product needs to ensure that the top is secured and the bottle does not leak!"
108468,5,"I have been using this product for almost a year now and I love the texture and results it's given me."
399407,4,"Mild smell and does help my 4C curls form better. Just wish it was more moisturizing. Using my husband's account."
282466,5,"Really like this product"
433859,5,"Love this cream! It smells so delicious but not overpowering and is really gentle!"
222563,5,"Best hair straightener I had in a while.  Straightens hair on the first pass.  Saves me a ton of time in the morning."
354380,5,"I love the texture of this sunblock. It applies easily and it gives my skin a lovely, matte finish rather than the shiny look that many other facial sunblocks I've tried have. I'm fairly pale, so I don't notice any whitish residue while applying. I only use it for my face, and the 1.7 oz size lasted about 10 months for me.

Will definitely purchase again, even with the price."
249933,5,"Great product; one of the best I've used for curly hair."
122357,4,"Overly powdery at times"
480152,5,"Leaves skin feeling great and helps moisturizers absorb better."
95815,3,"Don't smell original...but for the price...."
450341,5,"I have been using this product since month four (currently six months) twice a day and I have no stretch marks! It doesn't smell horrible like some do and a little bit goes a long way! Purchasing another right now!"
233145,1,"This product contains Octocrylene, which ""can penetrate into the skin where it acts as a photosensitizer. This results in an increased production of free radicals under illumination. Free radicals are known to induce indirect DNA DAMAGE and an increased concentration of free radicals might have contributed to the increased incidence of malignant melanoma in sunscreen-users compared to non-users.""  This is from a peer-reviewed, science journal.

The other active ingredient, avobenzone, easily penetrates the skin and is a strong free radical generator as well.

The whole purpose of sunscreen is to protect you from damage, not CAUSE it.

A much safer option is a sunblock - zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. They are photostable when exposed to radiation-aka sun rays and scatter the light rather than absorb it. They also protect BOTH kinds of harmful sun rays(UVA and UVB).

FYI: you should also avoid sunscreens containing PABA (causes breakouts and a possible carcinogen) and any other benzene compounds."
326948,5,"Great product.  My hands were very irritated, sore, and itchy.  After using the product for about 2 weeks my hands felt much better!!`"
443595,5,"This shampoo was recommended by my hair stylist. You need just a small amount to work up a good lather, and it does a good job of adding volume to thinning hair."

535587,5,"Beautiful light scent and so feminine! Indulge!"
555967,5,"This is the only product that does fade freckles"

154521,5,"I really the volumn this product gives my hair."
330514,5,"Works great."
569513,5,"This top coat works great on my glittery nail polish!"
425805,5,"It the product to have!!! So smooth and light weight, it does the job. Use to conceal a little or for a full coverage. This compact has everything you need weather to hid those blemishes, redness or dark circles (AND IT HAD A HIGHLIGHTER!!)  so far the best concealer I have in my makeup routine."
395406,2,"Not what I expected. It did not cover my grey well. I got dark brown but maybe I should of gotten black. My hair is dark brown so I thought it would work well but not so good."
414499,5,"I knew I liked this perfume from the moment I spritzed some on my wrists. It's an awesome fragrance; not too strong, not too light. It lasts for hours, which is good enough for me.

It's been a long while since I have braved going from the milder colognes to genuine longer-lasting perfume, but after reading the reviews I decided to get this Calvin Klein Euphoria... and I'm glad I did.

It's just the right blend of floral and woodsy to suit my tastes... and the men in my life agree.

With the cost of living so high now, everyone appreciates a good buy and since this name-brand perfume is $20. cheaper than my favorite department store, I am beyond pleased.

In addition to the fragrance being so pleasant, I think the bottle is well-designed... pretty, elegant and rosy pink... It looks lovely on my dresser next to a family photo in a mother-of-pearl frame.

I recommend this highly to anyone who likes their fragrance more light, airy and lasting. To describe it in one word... well, that would be ""euphoric."" :-)

79519,5,"I read the descriptions of the product and said very clearly that inside the box I should find the relaxer, the neutralizer and the instruction booklet. Unfortunately the booklet was not inside the box. So I had to go on the internet to try to find the instructions to apply the product. It seems this is ""recommended to use by a profesional""..oh., please. A beauty parlor charges you more than 500 dollars for this.  This, believe me, you can do it your self.  So in order for me to help all others who suffered the same as I, of not finding the instructions, here it goes:
To apply all steps you will need:
-Hair dryer (doesn't need to be Bio Ionic)
-Bio Ionic Conditioning straightener iron (Mus be Bio IOnic)
-Intensive Mosturizing Shampoo (if you buy the trio this product is inside)
-Intensive mosturizing reconstructor (if you buy the trio this product is inside)
- SHine sealer (if you buy the trio this product is inside)
-Hair coloring brush
-Plastic gloves
-Comb
This are the steps:
1- Wash the hair with the Bio Ionic Shampoo, rinse and towel dry.
2- Divide the head in 5 or 6 sections, and cover your hands with gloves.
3- Put the gloves on and tart applying the #1 Product. No not apply to scalp, leave 1/2 inch. Work fast, and the maximum time depending on the type of hair is 30 minutes (fine hair less time). Then start massaging each section. Te product on this step smells bad, so it's normal. Use a fine comb to work the roots near the face. After time is out. Rinse very well. Do not shampoo, but make sure you rinse well.
4-Blow dry the hair with the hands and dryer, then start using the Iron and make sure you do it very well from the root to the ends.
5- After you have finish ironing the hair, then you will need to apply the #2 (neutralizer). This will neutralize the #1 product still in your hair and will take all the bad odor from the hair and will stop the alcaline process from the number 1 product.
6- Rinse well and shampoo 3 times with the Bio Ionic Shampoo. Rinse and then apply the mosturizing reconstructor. Massage and wear a plastic cap for like 30 minutes.  Rinse well.
7- Towel Dry your hair. Apply shine sealer to wet hair. Then blow dry hair. If you prefer blow drying with a hair dryer or the Bio Ionic Iron.
This is a very time consuming process, but believe me it's worth it. No wonder why hair salons charges so much money. But you can do it at home.
It's recommended not to wear any rubber bands, bobby pins or anything that can leave a wave in you hair. . Avoid sweat, don't wet you hair during shower, and sleep with a satin pillowcase. All this measures just for 72 hours.
I wrote this steps because I did not like not receiving the intruction booklet. I think this is somewhat a way to make you go to a professional salon. Hair pro's are human and intellingent like me and you, If they cand do it so can we, so there you go, do it yourself and don't spend money in a beauty parlor. Good bye to you all!"
523943,3,"I try lots of products; I love trying different products. This is definitely nice, but I would not buy it again. Nothing special enough to warrant purchasing again."
220000,5,"This is really a great quality dryer for home use.  One of this things I love most about it is so comfortable to hold and to use.  It weighted evenly to doesn't  make your arm or hand tired when using it.  The hot setting is too hot for my frizz prone hair so I use Medium heat- which is perfect.  It is 2000W and it really does have more blowing power.  Also, the sound it's as high pitched and annoying as other dryers.  I can't say that it makes my hair any smoother so seems like the ion/nano claims are mostly marketing.  However, this s by far the best dryer I have owned so would highly recommend it to anyone!"
94466,5,"I LOVE this product!  I discovered this moisturizer at a day spa a couple years ago and it is the only one I will use now.  The scent is subtle and fresh.  Most importantly, it keeps my skin exceptionally moisturized and settles into the skin within a minute or two; NO GREASY feeling! I also have very sensitive skin and am prone to lotion allergies but have never had a problem with the epicuren products."
324678,2,"Unfortunately the reason why this product doesn't have an expiration date is because it doesn't have the Hydroquinone in it! That's what actually lightens the skin of you have hyperpigmentation due to sun exposure. Wish they would have mentioned in the description. It's confusing that Obagi has 2 very similar products labeled the same way but one with the Hydroquinone and the other without it."
198598,4,"L'Occitane shower gel for men belongs to a class of semi-luxury toiletries for men that means a great deal to the GQ reader and to older guys like me who remember 'Quality' in formulation and in fragrance in men's bathing and shaving materials.  The fragrance and the lathering (just enough, not too much) are in tune with tradition.  The lasting notes here are modest and herbal and they linger in a face cloth or on the skin throughout the day...if you get about an inch away from fabric or skin.  I find the fragrance to be 'beguiling but subtle.'  Skin and hair feel clean with no residue other than the subtle reminder of herbs. Too bad the product line doesn't include matching toiletries like a modern time-release molecular deodorant and cologne (well, I haven't seen one yet.)"
279185,2,"I thought it looked more silver so i got it and it looks more blue green. I buy OPI more than any other brand and when this one got to my door I just kept asking myself why? do I buy polish from them that looks wrost than the $1 polish thats at every store."

121102,2,"1: I had to go to the post office to pick up. I was then told three was 0.66 due for postage. This item was 0.15 ounce and with all the ""packing"" this seller had done it raised the weight of it to over 1 oz.  There was no reason why this count not have gone in a padded envelope!
2. The "" flavor"" of the product is very waxy & artificial. Tried it for a couple of days but just trashed it. I use other products from juice Beaty and am very satisfied with them but this one... Yuk"

144342,5,"I LOVE this curling iron! Be careful because it gets really HOT. The curls stay and last long. The best curling iron I've ever owned."
117150,5,"Great mild oil cleansing water.

 Over 20 years ago  or longer, when I would purchase a skin care system, it would include an astringent product that you would put on with a cotton ball  before  applying the moisturizers. The first time I reviewed one of many water-based cleansers such as this one, I was tempted to use them the same as I would an astringent  toner. Perhaps now these water-based products are more prevalent. There does appear to be many of them out on the market.  I have just noticed that. While some conventional cleansers might do very well at removing dirt, and leaving some residue, there is nothing better in my opinion than wiping my face clean until the cotton pad shows no signs of make up for dirt.

I have found that with these particular types of products, they are gentle cleansers that you do not  need to wash off; they are also products that I assume would replace a regular daily cleanser,  and would be applied with a cotton ball or cotton pad. For the exception of removing waterproof mascara and eyeliner,  this product  is just great for me. I might have this bias based on the fact that I have been using products like this for a couple of years. When I use a particular cleanser -  let's say a traditional one such as something soap-based  I  eventually take a shower anyway, so my quandary is, do I put my moisturizer on after the shower?  No, I  use a water-based  cleanser. This one is particularly for oily skin and, this particular brand has some very effective products that prevent breakouts. They also treat  breakouts.  However, I do not look at this product as something drying to the skin; if anything it promotes the balance of the skin.  In that way it is gentle.  This product is not really a toner, as with the alcohol-based toner. It is clean,clear, gentle. While this product has some fragrance, it is barely detectable.  However, unlike the other water-based products I use, this has a slight bit of suds if I'm not mistaken. Only a bit of bubbly only on the surface of the liquid as if it has been shaken.  Very little though.  This is a very pure product sans alcohol and soap.  I have often wondered if a product that is made up mainly of water can be effective.  Then I am reminded how most cleansers or washes make me break out.

I recommend this one in particular because of its claim of being oil free. And since I liked the mask that I got from this company a while back,  I now  use a mask on my face periodically, and then apply this product afterword  - and always before moisturizer which I use day and night.  It's a wonderful thing. I recommend this brand and this product. By the way, I use a stronger one that is more emollient to clean off my waterproof mascara and eyeliner.  I don't need facials because the oil free cleanser made by this company eliminates oil buildup which appear as rough skin as on my nose, making my skin clear to be cleaned and good to go."
434391,5,"Absolutely love this. I use it everyday. Totally worth the money"
286183,5,"all I can say is WOW.  this stuff is amazing.  I have severe dry skin, probably because I don't drink enough water, but most products I've tried make my hands look great for 10 minutes, then back to alligator skin.  Put this on before bed, woke up and while there are hints of dryness, my hands look soooooo much better."
284590,5,"I love the Marvis products! Truly a luxury toothpaste. They're one of my indulgences, and for something you have to use every day, what better way to spoil yourself a little? They not only taste and smell yummy, I think they do a better job than my husband's Colgate, and a little goes a long way. A lot of the American toothpastes I use make my skin break out around my mouth and chin, and since switching to Marvis, I don't have that problem at all. The tubes are pretty too!

My favorites are the cinnamon mint, the liquorice, and the aqua mint. Marvis sell sample packs and sizes so you can try the smaller size before investing in the full size tube."

308642,4,"Ive used the PMD once a week for a month and I must say that I am happy with the results so far. I suffer from moderate acne and have noticed that my face is alot smoother and even erased the tiny forehead wrinkles. Ive also noticed that it made my pores smaller.

Another factor that have helped is that I drink LOTS of water now. So overall, I am happy and hope for clear skin by spring!"
1821,5,"I used to have a professional flat iron from my sister in law who is a hair stylist. When it broke I was devastated that it would be expensive to replace it. This flat Iron heats up quickly and one pass on each section and I am done. My hair is flat and shiny in minutes. I would definitely buy this item again!!"
107664,5,"I gave this to my mom for Christmas and she loves it! Now I want one for myself!"
16663,5,"This is either for long hair or if you just want a wave to your hair.  Hot Tools is always my favorite for curling irons & the heat dial helps me so that I don't fry my fine, processed hair. You do have to be careful you don't hold it near the dial & adjust it accidentally but that shouldn't be that difficult for most people."
180409,5,"Great Value!"
520448,1,"In the winter months, my skin gets dry, flaky, and inflamed even though I get an oily T-zone with clogged comodones.  I have rosacea, and ever since I lived in Israel for two years, I have used Ahava. I swear by the stuff.

Not so with this tube of fire-inducing, creamy face wash.  I am not sure if it's the fragrance or some chemical in it, but even when I keep a generous half inch away from my eye, good mercy--it begins to burn until I wish to claw at my eyeballs.  I'm not the shrieking Gollum type, but I will tell you, after using this each and every time, my eyes end up redder than the Eye of Sauron. (nerd fact.)

Also, my skin is even dryer after using this product than before washing it.  I will never buy this product again.

All that being said, my first shipment didn't arrive at my house (but was signed for and stolen by someone else) and within a day, Amazon had a new tube of it all boxed up and sitting on my doorstep.  Even if the product is a modern form of torture, at least Amazon continues to amaze."
57334,5,"Very pleased with the price, it took about 10 days to arrive."
570684,2,"Does add length to eyelashes, but is very sticky and makes my eyelashes clump. I already have pretty long eyelashes -- was looking for something that made them look more full. This is not it. Wouldn't recommend."
494453,2,"The product worked for the first several days but then my skin broke out again."
514469,1,"The sprayer does not work ---- it cannot be used.  I have had to actually pour some into my hand and put it on my hair.  This purchase was a total waste of my money.  Amazon owes me either a bottle that works or a refund."
138931,5,"Hands down one of the best face washes I have ever used. Cleans your face and doesn't leave it dry. Has a great pleasant smell. Highly recommend using all of their products. Two thumbs up!"
169484,5,"This is a beautiful dark green.  You'll need 2 coats but its worth it.  It's an unusual color of green, one you don't see anywhere else."
482518,1,"Wore off within 30 minutes, had to return and the product payoff was barely there!"
213375,2,"This is a great product, seems to help reduce fine lines with regular use, however .... no matter how much product is in the cannister, you're not going to get much opportunity for ""regular use"" after a couple of weeks, because the pump will stop working, and the product inside is then inaccessible. Forget about just trying to screw the cap off to shake some out. Not happening. I've bought this item three times in an effort to replace a bottle that stopped working. Same problem all three times. I give up. Won't buy again, unless offered in a tube or other container that doesn't malfunction so that most of the product can't be used."

206987,5,"This is my third safety razor and was a little hesitant to buy the razor because of the aggressive blade exposure.  I have been using safety razors for the past 7 months and have had no issues it just takes a little extra prep but the shave is worth the time. The Merkur 39C is a very fine razor.  The quality of the razor is everything that was advertised.  I did 2 passes and the shave was close and comfortable.  Great razor I will buy another Merkur in the near future."
108163,2,"I have fine/ wavy hair that is a little difficult but not impossible to curl. I currently have a one inch ceramic cheap curler that works great but I wanted a bigger curl so I got the Hot tools 1 1/2 inch ceramic titanium curler. It does not create a curl that lasts longer than two minutes... literally. I have really long hair so I know it's not just that the barrel is too big, it just doesn't work with my hair. The curler doesn't really seem to get that hot either. Holding it on my hair for 30 seconds barely heats up my hair. Really disappointed."
401747,5,"I love it, takes away all of the frizzy ends and leaves my hair in better condition."
492272,1,"This is NOT the original Pevonia, perhaps a duplicate, or failed try?  It smells, the original Pevonia oil had a nice light fragrance, this is heavy and it stinks.  I bought them in Nov., so I guess it's been too long to return them, I still have 2 unopened that will go in the garbage can.  Won't order this again, will use the Mogador oil instead."
153193,5,"I love this shampoo.  It helps with the winter dryness."
79865,1,"I bought this product which appeared IDENTICAL to the conditioner I purchased at the hair salon.  After I used it and had very different results from the original, I read the ingredient list which indicated the product had a different formula.  This would have been OK BUT since the packaging was identical to the salon product, I could not easily determine the differences.  The original salon product gives much better results."
544940,5,"Love the price and product"
276446,3,"Its ok. Will finish it, but won't reorder."
161309,5,"love love love--my favorite scrub!"
551640,4,"The coverage that Dermablend is famous for does not disappoint in this product. I prefer a medium coverage, but find that most medium or light coverage foundations take more than one application to get the desired coverage I want. Then full coverage is often more like paint than foundation. This lets me control that coverage a bit more when I blend it with an illuminating serum. This helps me thin it out, but still give me a solid full coverage that I'm looking for.
I use a  brush to apply and a blender sponge to even things out and blend the last bits. Then after this, just a blender for any concealer and a standard fluffy brush for blush after this. I use a bit of setting powder, and I'm done till usually mid-afternoon when I touch a few spots up with my blender and take an oil sheet to my face.
This can be a bit cakey if you don't put it on and blend it in thin, but it's not too bad if you work with it a bit."
151540,5,"I washed my hair (frizz-bomb special) applied the product as directed on the website. Then I brushed it back and put into tight ponytail.  Too tired to blow it dry.  (I know...directions said to blow dry; then and there, but, too exhausted.  This morning I was really shocked after it undid the ponytail.
My hair felt smooth and I brushed it and it was smooth!
Quick job with hot rollers....and off I went.
Great stuff...buy it, you'll love it.

P.S. Am allergic to awful hair products' smell and this was wonderful,  no problem."
166187,5,"IT WORKS GREAT! I LOVE IT! I just wish it wouldn't wash out!"
561478,2,"Color is pretty, but it streaks when it goes on.  By the time you get it to look even, it looks heavy and globby."
427319,5,"Arrived on time, intact.  No problems."
105594,5,"This is a combination cleanser, toner and makeup remover that's soothing and gentle even on my fair, sensitive skin.

I like that it goes on like water and doesn't tend to leave a sticky residue the way some competing products sometimes do. I also like that there's not much in the way of fragrance - just a clean, fresh result. And best of all, it works great, cleaning and taking off makeup while leaving your skin soft, clean and refreshed without any of the harshness you get from many other products. Stubborn waterproof makeup sometimes takes two or three passes, but I prefer that to a stronger product that might leave me feeling raw. A little goes a long way, so the price represents good value when you consider how many uses you get from a single purchase.

Definitely worth a try if you're looking for a gentle way to clean your skin and leave it feeling and looking its best."
553151,1,"I've been using the original mint flavor for years and tried a couple different flavored ones in the past and was very happy with my purchases. I usually buy these at Sephora or the local apothecary, but I moved and they are harder for me to stop somewhere to purchase so I added this package to my amazon order. SUUUUUUUPER DISAPPOINTED!!!

These have been altered no doubt. The ingredients/fragrance are not the same at all. If the packaging has been bootlegged and sold as the real product, the seller did a great job. However, you can't fake the funk with this. The scent is unbearable and I can't believe these to be made by the Jack Black manufacturer.

Just save y"
347384,5,"Great product! I use it all the time and it always does the trick!"
529190,2,"too expensive for this little thing and not sure if it is working"
103318,5,"Im often disappointed by beauty products, but Nail Envy rocks! I have the thinnest, weakest, most bendable nails that often split into layers.  I started using this months ago and now is the only nail product I use.  It is easy.  Two coats on, then add a coat every other day for seven days, then take it off and start over again.  It dries in a very short time. Completely. In humidity, in dry air.  You can put it on as you are walking out the door in the morning and it is dry by the time you make it to the next block.  It does chip, but if you add another coat over the chips, unlike nailpolish you cant tell that your nail covering was chipped at all.  For the first time with anything I have used I have been able to grow my nails long and thick and strong."
324033,5,"These soaps are the best I've ever used. I don't use them all the time as they are more expensive than traditional soap, but every so often I treat myself. The smell really does linger and, in my opinion, is a great smell. Even opening the package you will be impressed at the presentation. Lathering up will only widen your smile!"

544670,4,"Love it but quite expensive"
275376,5,"Before, I was using so many different products, such as glue 2 gel, america crew cream, and bryllcream hair products. I thank my friend who recommended me this product. I have been using this product for about 2 years now and I love the fact that I don't get dandruff or dried scallops from the product compared to gel products and others. I use only a finger dab of pomade just to make my whole hair. When I wash it off, it comes off easily and doesn't leave me with damages."

Amal Mattevelvet goes on with a definite sparkle/glitter, which I was surprised by, since it is a matte polish. But when it dries, it dries matte on top with a bit of sparkle underneath. Very pretty. The Amal color is a cheerful red and is brighter than pictured (at least as pictured on my screen)."

214342,2,"I like to apply a thick eyeliner over the eyelid since I have monolids. This applied a little more difficult as the brush was a bit flimsy. It takes a little longer to dry. The color dries to a matte gray color, but can get darker with multiple applications. It is not good for long wear and will start moving if your eyes are watery. It will start cracking towards the end of the day and it does need a primer especially if you're going to use a shimmery eye shadow right under it. I will definitely not repurchase it. I gave it two stars because of the ingredients, and I could wear it on days that I'll know I will be taking off the makeup in a few hours."

Im going to copy and paste this exact review for the other cosmedix products i purchased, they were all horrible and damaged my skin badly"

323895,4,"I like this iS Clinical Active Serum, you can feel a slight tingling feeling when you first apply it, but then it goes away pretty quickly. I have oily skin in some areas of my face, and this serum seems to tighten up my skin a little. It makes my skin look much healthier. I wouldn't say that I saw a huge difference in making any wrinkles disappear, but it did a good job of tightening my skin, and making it appear healthier, so for that I like it. I just think they can come down on the price, because there are other products that will do the same thing that are much less expensive."
236319,5,"My face is very sensitive lately, blotchy, dry and oily, it peels, I get hives out of the blue.  This cleanser, after using it last night and this morning, is a KEEPER!!! I love it.  You can feel how gentle it is as you massage your face, then when you wipe it off, your face is like butter.  Fresh, clean, softer than I ever saw it, and soothed.  A girl on You Tube said she used it, and I liked her skin, so I said, well, I tried everything else, let me try it.  I am soooo glad I did. It is awesome.  I am getting more today, just so I will have it."

If you have naturally curly /frizzy hair, I promise you .... you will absolutely love this!"
284576,5,"love this toothpaste.. I think i'll never go back"
484234,5,"I actually really like this product. I am very picky with everything to be quite honest. I actually got this after using the regular version for a good year (didn't like that one at first, but as I got better at applying, I grew to love it). I much prefer this one to the regular as it gives me the desired color I want from a fake tan. I want to look like I have been on tropical vacation for a week, and this does that for me. Very natural looking tan. Whenever I use it, my friends compliment me on my skin. My mom doesn't like the idea of fake tanners, but when she saw it on, she even agreed it looked as though I had just come back from a vacation. I do wish that St tropez would come out with a 1.7oz bottle for the dark as well. That was I could travel with it. But that is something I'll just have to wait for."

I have not tried the pink color yet."

This product basically smelled like old standing water and it did not hydrate or condition in any way. My normally healthy hair was tangled and brittle.

52666,5,"Great perfume. Great balance and smooth perfume for men."
155303,5,"Most others have butane or propane in them. This smells nice and can keep extending life in your hair for as long as you need.  I have black hair so I put it on at night and wake up the next day and my hair looks nice and clean.  I've put it in during the day and it's fine too, maybe some residue for a bit until it's completely brushed through but I didn't expect anything else. All in all this is the best dry shampoo I have ever used."
58153,5,"Works pretty darn good.  Not waterproof, but very OK for everyday."
29221,5,"I loved it !"
329559,5,"This cream is excellent for skin suffering from redness/rosacea. I have been using it for years and switch to the Riche version in the winter. I also use it as eye cream mixed with rosehip oil or on its own. The online downside is the price: this is a very affordable pharmacy product in France, I wish it was similarly priced here."
317570,5,"Need more time to use but so far takes away red rashly patches of skin"

149481,4,"It works well. It takes days to vanish a pimple. For people that want a quick result, i would recommend the Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch, but it works just for yellowish pimples."
10376,4,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this face wash!  Even though it's a mens line, I gave into a recommendation by a lady at Nordstroms with the most perfect skin I have ever seen.  I'm glad I did, I noticed an improvement in my skin almost immediately, the only reason I did not give it the 5th star is because of the packaging.  I wish that they would instead sell it in a more squeezable tube or in a bottle with a pump (I've seen the larger size does come with a pump).  It can be a little challenging to squeeze the product out of this bottle especially with wet hands.  Other than that, the product itself is AMAZING.  Side note: I have rosacea & very sensitive skin, this works fine with it & does not irritate.  I do not have dry skin or I would use their green formula (algae)- my mom uses that one & is happy with it for those with dry skin..."
370464,5,"I use the top coat over the Vinylux Nail Enamel and it really makes the nail enamel ""pop.""  It also seals the enamel very nicely and the manicure does stay for several days without chipping.  So far, I am every pleased with the top coat."

I turned it on, makes a slight noise.  Will be asking to return it!!"
48480,3,"I bought this at the recommendation of a friend who had used it.  I guess I was expecting miracles, but doesn't seem any better than my other eye products - Neutrogena or Olay - which cost much less and can be bought in the drug store.  I haven't noticed any difference in the lines near my eyes or bags under them.  It does moisturize, but so do the others."
361218,5,"Love it, so much pigment I also have the peach shade."
319030,4,"Use this every day with my clarisonic brush. At the beginning, it made my skin soft and clear. After about a year, it isn't as strong as it used to be. My skin is sensitive and I was too scared to try the clarisonic brand face washes. Sometimes I feel it is too gentle and doesn't get the job done. The price was another downside. I finish these in three weeks."

6904,5,"Dries your nails in seconds!  I'm the one that always messes up a manicure, with this product I have yet to mess my polish after a manicure.  Love this product!"
105310,2,"I wanted to love this. The description sounded just like something Id like and i hoped that the toilette parfum would be light enough to wear to work and not offend anyone. Plus I have used other products from Crabtree and Evelyn and been pleased. Alas, it was not to be. I have a sensitive nose, overly sensitive probably. But this was all kinds of no. No with a capital NUH uh. The was to lavender as banana popsicles are to bananas. I adore a good fresh lavender but this was not a clear astringent lavender, it was a chemical maelstrom of lavender. It has a heavy alcohol top note, which is to be expected with a toilette water but it hung on much longer than I wanted, but the powdery middle note was just odd and it lasted much too long in that middle range of too strong to be two hours old. Then the bottom note is too much Grandmas hankie drawer for me, though it was more in the muted range I expected.

My advice if you want to try it because you like that old fashioned type of scent is to apply it properly- spray into the air and walk through it, never apply directly to the skin. Or try using it as a light room spray or closet spray. I don't want to preach here but gone are the days of women wearing heavy scents into work and getting away with it. So many of us are crammed into more reconditioned air and we all need to be sensitive to the noses of our coworkers. No one wants to be remembered as that strongly stinky person in the office. Your scent should be special to you and to anyone who is close enough to share it in your personal space."
560521,5,"My hair feels absolutely amazing. I have such a tough time getting my hair to stay hydrated and REVIV3 truly helped. Its all natural which is so hard to find at a reasonable price which this absolutely is. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to make their haircare routine better! It also smells great and minty fresh which is always a plus!"
529961,2,"Very drying to skin.  Probably wait until warmer weather to use."
550020,4,"I enjoy this product. It absorbs nicely into the skin, and doesnt cause my face to break out. The reason I gave it four stars and not five, is because its a tab bit runny, and pours out quickly from the tube."
471324,5,"I LOVE this hair straightener. In college one of my roommates had this type and I would constantly steal it to do my hair. It is by far THE BEST straightener I have ever tried. I love that you can control the heat and it works so quickly. I have thick curly hair that it not easy to straighten and this iron not only gets the job done but it also works FAST. I can do my whole head in under 20 minutes when my old straightener would easily take 30-45 minutes for a similar result. Seriously can't recommend enough!"
189038,5,"I gave this as a gift to a friend and she loved it.  Fast shipping too!"

319985,5,"easy to clean your face."
383350,4,"This product is not for everyday use due to the application process. I had to watch YouTube videos on how to apply. However, it is amazing color and gives a wonderful step up for special occasions. I have oily eyelids and its hard to find a eyeshadow that does not crease but this one will not budge! No matter how hot or humid. Delivery was fast also."
429968,1,"Like SO MANY others have posted, I also purchased this item 2 months ago. Stopped turning on, won't charge and is rusted inside the head. I called Amazon and explained to them my case and they were happy to send me a return label so I can ship the item back and grant me a full refund. When is this scam artist going to be removed from Amazon?????"
300207,5,"Love it!!  Such a moist sunscreen. Never feels greasy or sticky.  Easy to apply."
287051,5,"I am extremely pale so I actually use this eye shadow to highlight my cheekbones and nose. No shimmer whatsoever and very pretty."
298025,5,"Fits the Clarisonic Mia brush.  Nice bristles for acne- it's not too soft or hard.  Will buy again, nice product."
12551,5,"perfectly light on the skin"
467624,5,"Full disclosure:  Ive been in a makeup rut for literally years, where I wore black eye shadow almost exclusively; the most I ever deviated from that was a little white/silver on the brow bone and maybe the lid from time to time.  Its only in the last two years or so that Ive begun using an actual color on my lid, and accenting with black in the crease.  When I do go for color, I tend to prefer darker ones, and I normally stick with purples, greys, and greens. And yes, I am a huge fan of Urban Decay.

That said, I was so thrilled with how these shadows from Japonesque looked when they arrived.  I had thought they looked nice online, but I wasn't prepared to fall in love with this set as much as I have.

The set contains four Pro Basics colors:  two pale nudes, a cocoa nude, and a black.  Then there are the six Pixelated colors: two very different purples (one leans more toward blue, the other toward red), a silver, a grey, a green, and a bronze.  Neither the photo on the Japonesque site nor the photos on Amazon do any of them justice.  But trust me when I say that the colors are simply divine. The pixelated colors are really vibrant, both in the case and on the skin.  The Pro Basic colors are a bit more subdued, but the two paler colors have a light shimmer and the cocoa and black are both matte.

Ive used all of the colors except the cocoa; brown eye shadow is not a good look for me. I did use a bit of Urban Decays Primer Potion with them, which worked very well.  For each look I paired either one of the pale nude colors or one of the pixelated colors on the lid with the soft black in the crease and outer corner, finishing with black eye liner and mascara  basically my normal look. I was very happy with the way all of the colors looked using them this way (though I will admit, the black in the crease probably does tone them down a bit). Even the bronze  which I was really hesitant to use  looked great (very autumnal).

I didn't notice a lot of fallout on my face when using these, though you will see some excess powder in the case (especially with the black).  That actually surprised me, since they just looked like theyd be grainy.  I used both brushes and sponge applicators (depending on where I was applying and how much coverage I wanted).  I didn't have any trouble blending the black into the crease and the coverage and opacity of all of the colors was great. The shadows have all held up well through a full day of work, which is a neat trick considering I have the oiliest skin ever.  I haven't had any irritation at all from the pixelated colors, and I am a contact lens wearer. They were also easy to remove with my regular cold cream and a warm, wet face cloth.

The set does not include applicators nor a brush. Im not sure if thats a plus or a minus though, since with few exceptions the applicators and brushes included in makeup sets tend to be low quality. Except for the UD ones Ive gotten, I tend the just chuck them.

The Amazon price is $38 for the palette, which contains 16.4 grams of eye shadow. Compare that to Urban Decays new Vice 4 palette, which costs $60 for about 16 grams, or one of their Naked palettes which is about 13 grams of makeup for $54.  I personally think this is the better deal for the quality and color payoff you get and given that I adore and will use all of the colors in the set except one  I cant say that about a lot of palettes, even Urban Decay ones."
569456,1,"First let me say,I NEVER review products. Only reviewing because my nails actually hurt. Im also embarrassed of the photo Ive just posted for the world to see, this should magnify how upset I am that Im posting this photo.
Second, my nails have never been the envy of my friends, BUT they sure looked 1000% better before I used Butter products.
Third, Normal nail polish NEVER stays on my nails no mater how hard I try. Therefore
Fourth, I tried Butter products due to the fact they were free of harmful chemicals. And wanted  a polished nail for a formal event. Bought about July 17th-ish.
Fifth, I bought a crystal glass nail file  - could this be the cause of horrible nails? I don't know but I have quit using file and Butter products. I will leave a review for the nail file product as well.
Note : I did buy several Butter products. Melt Away/ Cuticle Exfoliator - Nail Foundation/ Priming Basecoat -  Tinted Moisturizer.
Usage: Melt Away - clean nail - applied Priming base coat alone.
  Melt Away - clean nail - applied Tinited Moisturizer.
Pro: - these products might have stayed on my nails 1 to 2 days longer than most. I did like the natural color/hue of the tinted moisturizer and primer.,
Cons: - see photo! Nails are splitting and peeling with no end in sight.  Splitting so deep it will take forever to grow out. Wish I had a before photo of my nails. ( no splitting of layers  might be the nails some would be envious of)

CAN NOT say how mad and dissapointed I am. If the Butter people actually read these reviews -  would love for them to get in touch with me. I might be the needle in the hay stack of happy Butter lovers.

TO BE FAIR - will let nails grow out then use the crystal nail file again (on only one nail) to see if the splitting occurs and then give Butter more stars if I determine the file is the cause."
48913,5,"This product really works! I smile more freely now. It really does written crowns as well. I feel so much more confident."
393419,4,"A good pencil that makes a nice fine line that can easily be 'smudged' for a smokey look. Stays on a full 24 hours but is not completely waterproof. Having said that, I would buy it again."
220752,5,"EXCELENTE!"
245551,5,"This is the best hair spray - especially for fine hair - holds well but isn't sticky. Been using it for years but is difficult to find locally since most salons stock only the 'currently popular' and more expensive products. was finally please with courteous service on purchasing of Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine Super Finishing Spray"

68317,5,"Love it! Won't use anything else."
134312,4,"I love this lip balm!  It's very moisturizing with a lasting effect, and the pomegranate color looked great.  The reason for 4 and not 5 stars is that it's a bit expensive, and application is a bit annoying.  I dislike having colored balm on my fingers, and I hate using fingers as an applicator (can be gross if shared)."
288480,5,"I received a sample of this at work and loved it from the first time I used it.  It absorbs in very nicely and has a pleasant smell, not perfumey at all. The men in my life use it as well. I had to buy one for me and one for them. I will be a repeat costumer."
293943,4,"I like the wear and durability but its comes out much more darker/pigmented than I thought it would."

541903,5,"Amazing! Love it!!!!! Best highlighter ever!!!!"
384185,3,"The moisturizer has a smooth texture that is not too oily. It is not actively scented but still has a 'cream' smell. I'm not sure it's possible to make any cream that has absolutely no scent. The big question is whether or not this is an anti-aging cream. I doubt it. It's a fine moisturizer but to be honest, for the price, I don't think it lives up to the billing. If you don't mind spending the money then there's not reason not to buy it, but just don't expect any miracles."
170217,1,"I used it 2 months and haven't seen any effect: no hydration, no pores cleaning. Very dissapointed with this product. Maybe it's suitable for people with dry skin, not with combination or oily skin."
162904,5,"This is the 3rd jar that I've bought.  I keep it in the shower and after I wash my face I use this on my lips. It makes your lips feel so soft and smooth.  Definitely worth the money and I will be buying it again."
481589,5,"Loved this gift box!  Lots of samples that I have been trying and have already placed my first order based off of one of the samples and plan to buy a few more of the items.  What a cute box it came in!  Would definitely get the sample box again!!!"
292259,5,"Oribe makes the best hair products on the planet.  Unfortunately, I'm allergic to the fragrance."
29380,1,"CAREFUL! FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!!! Very very much disappointed! Everything is like in the previous comment! Huge mistake I didn't read it before making an order :( ""I just got my zoya black matte nail polish today and was so excited to use it, but when I tried it on there's was a lot of sparkles and it was shiny. It was totally opposite of what I expected and to make it worst this product is way overpriced and falsely advertised."" Agree 100%!! And that suspicious return policy, which is available to a customer only after the product is bought...is that legal at all?? Now I'm not able to return it, and don't want to use it either, because it looks awful and because it is not what I was buying!"
215925,5,"Awesome dry shampoo! (Blow Pro's faux dry is a similar product that has also worked very well for me)! Klorane's non-aerosol gentle dry shampoo is wonderful! Klorane and Blow Pro have different primary ingredients (Klorane uses rice starch, while Blow Pro uses corn starch). I love how effective Klorane's gentle dry shampoo is at reviving my tired, flat hair while still being so gentle on my sensitive scalp! I have eczema and very dry skin year-round, and this product does not irritate whatsoever! I highly recommend it! I also love the non-aerosol version! It can be a little trickier to apply evenly than the aerosol version, but I have found that it lasts sooo much longer! The 1.7 ounce non-aerosol bottle will last me at least 6 months, and that is with me using it almost every day!"
297972,5,"Perfect match, just as described."
390229,4,"I was very skeptical of this toner at first. It felt like water on my skin. I didn't get the same stripping 'alcohol' effect that I was used to from other toners. I didn't think it was working. I had the typical T-zone, mostly oily, but dry in patches. After 4 weeks of Obagi, I do feel like my skin is more balanced. Now, there's no dry patches or oily spots. My skin feels less stressed, if that makes sense. Definitely, it is feeling more natural. It is a very gradual change, so you have to be patient. My only negative is the relatively high price tag. But you get what you pay for."
472158,5,"These temporarily filled in some faint lines by ultra hydrating some of the skin under the eyes and on the forehead.  It was easy to apply and didn't go on greasy.  It seemed to have a couple hours of face-life in 80 degree dry heat.  A little went a long way but the bottle probably wouldn't be enough for everyday use for a full month.

I couldn't find any actual ingredient list for this product so I probably wouldn't use it again."
117847,5,"I have used this product for about 5 years, my hair is very thin and totally gray. This product works well with both shine and volume!"
86531,5,"Nice!"
482447,3,"I thought I was being pranked, because surely no conditioner is supposed to smell like a goat barn. I'm glad to see other reviewers thought so too. It leaves my hair silky and shiny, so I put some in smaller bottles with scented oils. It helps a little. Hopefully they will amend this problem, and I remember next time to smell before I buy."
66381,5,"I love Jane Iredale makeup you don't have to wear a lot to look good!"

397241,5,"Great product for us 40 year old trying to hang on to our youth by way of the wallet!"
255016,5,"Loving this eye liner. I went to the Pride parade and it was like 200 degrees out. I was a sweaty mess but my liner was fabulous. Anything that can survive blazing hot sun and sweat deserves its 5 star review. I will say, it is a shiny kind of liner, not matte, so just be prepared for that."
1415,2,"Smells great but hardly protects from odor for longer than 4 hours.  This has never happend with any other deodorant.  Ive realized its because barely any is applied after about 4 swipes under the arm."
495459,5,"I am 35 and have tried EVRYTHING I could find on my skin. Since I was little I have always had deep lines on my forehead, and they have always bothered me. I have tried everything (reasonably cost wise) to combat this.
I first found this on a Groupon and it came with the Dr. Brant Microdermabrasion (which is also fantastic). So I would use the microdermabrasion and then put this on here and there. Then I started to use it everyday just to see what would happen. THIS HAS CHANGED MY LIFE! I use it everyday. And you only need a little. So this size will last me months!
 After about 2 weeks of using it everyday, I could see a HUGE difference in my deep lines/wrinkles. My pores have got smaller, my face is way more hydrated (I had a few dry spots - they are gone now). I cant believe I found something that ACTUALLY works. I use this after my Lancme Genifique and before my Ole Henriksen sheer transformation. I have waiting to see my forehead smooth for YEARS!
It is expensive, but when you put it on correctly (using very little) this should last for months. The results are incredible! It does have a weird smell, but its all natural and you MUST keep the inner lid on it because it will change color if not. The less air that gets to it, the better.
I cant tell you how much I love this stuff. I have been using this for a few months now and I don't think I could live without it.
SO hooked! My skin looks better then it did 10 years ago!
If you're not sure, go to Sephora and see if you can get a sample. Use it for a week and see what you think. And it is WAY cheaper on Amazon then anywhere else (I've looked). It's $125 everywhere else."
425031,5,"I usually buy this at Sephora but Amazon has the best price. This product works well, but you need to use the mitt with it, otherwise you will get streaks"

570315,2,"Smells great however on my adult skin with even a water softener my skin is still dry."
389878,4,"Great value.  It works well if you don't use too much.  If you happen to get too much, it leaves your hair a little clumpy.  I do love that it comes in a pump instead of a tube."

It looks like it could never work and delicate looking but it is a dead skin eating monster!  Lay a towel under your foot while you work and you are going to be so surprised and what this removes and polishes your skin to a beautiful healthy look.  I have passed these type of callous removers by in the past thinking no way but the porous stone on the front does burr away your dead skin with little pressure.  I never felt any discomfort using this. This along with a foot rasp are all you'll need this summer to keep your pedicures beautiful.  No more old lady feet!!"
428435,5,"A colleague who has beautiful skin recommended Skin Medica Vitamin C&E. I have been using this product ever since. It definitely has made a difference. Since I have extremely sensitive skin, I am very happy that I've had no issues. It's been just the opposite. Thanks SkinMedica!"

384194,3,"I like almost every product by Loccitane. This particular product was just too much for my skin. I realize it was meant for dry skin which I have, but this felt greasy to me.

393699,4,"I found this foundation at an airport in Istanbul (I didn't have any of my makeup, it's a long story). Having red and acne-burdened skin, this product is quite great, because it's got MAJOR coverage, probably the most I've ever had with a foundation, and it's not goopy or thick. My only complaint is that it's a little too orange."
395369,5,"Okay if you have to get your roots done every four weeks like I do and you're not even making it four weeks before you have gray, this is the perfect product for you!  I love it!  It is easy to apply, long lasting, and does not make your hair feel grimy or icky like it does with the various crayons or paste-like products I have tried. It is also less damaging that buying a root touch up kit every two weeks.  For $34.50 this may seem expensive but I feel it will last a minimum of 6 months. I also recommend going darker than your hair for better coverage.  I got the dark brown and my hair is auburn brown.  I also love that it has two ends on the brush so you can apply it more accurately.  If your hair is super clean it doesn't stick as well so I give my roots a light spray of hairspray before applying."

319894,2,"It didn't take off my waterproof mascara, and I noticed after a few minutes my eyes were so dry to the point of burning. It was the weirdest sensation. It did take off my face makeup and was fairly gentle. I think the Garnier one is just as good and requires less rubbing to get the makeup off."

183658,5,"Works well. Don't shake the bottle! Depending on how often you use this it can go pretty quick and it can get costly fast, however, I don't mind because I feel it's worth it. I am a big fan of Mario Badescu products."

418524,3,"It's got such a strong odor that I don't know if I can use this.  I like the greasiness of it and it works well for me to hold my hair where I want it to be, but the scent is what I'd most closely consider to be ""bathroom deodorizer.""  It has an industrial urinal cake sort of smell or something.  It's just 'off.'  I'll be using it when I'm outdoors on windy days.  I already know my wife is going to hate the smell and people around me might wonder why I smell like the janitor's closet in public."

It leaves your skin feeling very soft and evens out your complexion. Compared to other cream based primers, you don't even feel this on your skin, while a cream primer feels heavier. Helps give a great soft look when makeup is applied. My wife didn't experience any negative skin reaction from this. This is one of the best primers she has tried. Excellent product."

365984,4,"The moisturizing aspect of this lotion is highly effective and it has a somewhat strong but pleasant smell. The ingredient list is healthy and all natural. It's a simple 20% zinc-oxide formula so it's safe for me and my children. However, being a mineral sunscreen it's more difficult to spread than the more commonly available sunscreens and it doesn't completely blend in. That's the downside to natural sunscreens, they're all like that but I've used several of them and this one is much better than most. It's also expensive but a little goes a long way. However, due to the price I mainly use it on my face and use cheaper stuff on my body. It's also highly water resistant and it's held up well while swimming and cycling in hot, wet Florida. The bottom line is that it does everything it's supposed to do and it does it well but know what you're getting into when you buy this type of sunscreen."

I'm trying to see if there's a certain moisturizer I can use (coconut oil maybe?) so that I can reap the benefits of this product. Just be warned that it REALLY dries out your skin. It's embarrassing and painful. I have cracks on either side of my mouth and under my nose. My entire face is flaky. And I STILL have acne. The picture I uploaded is after a month or so of use. I am wearing makeup in the picture to cover the acne that is still there. You can see the flakes. It looks awful in person. It is an embarrassment."
105345,5,"If you have dry skin due to the weather where you live, this is the relief you are looking for. Put it on lightly as it is oil and you'll feel wet after putting it on. But if you have dry skin, it absorbs quickly and leaves your arms and legs feeling soft. No more itchy or flaky skin due to dryness. I bought multiple bottles last time so I don't run out. It makes great massage oil too."

456575,2,"I tried this product a couple of times, each time I put it on over my makeup, but I have to say that it didn't illuminate my skin as expected, I honestly could not see the difference to my skin after applying it other than it added a different color to my skin. It was easy to apply (it looks like a pearly lotion) it comes out through the small brush after you press on the end of the applicator, and even though you're suppose to use the brush to distribute it, I also ended up using my fingers to smooth it into my skin. I noticed that the color actually looked a little bit lighter on my face once applied (I'm a brunette and I had the nor color).

Additionally, after applying it, my skin didn't feel any softer, if anything, it felt a little tight. I honestly don't think it's worth the price and I would not recommend it."
195417,1,"I have been buying Paul Mitchell products for the last couple of years and I have always been satisfied, until now.  This product stinks like cheap perfume, the smell is so bad that it will give you a headache!!.  I doubt this is an original product.  The seller says the reason for this is because Paul Mitchell changed the scent to strawberry bubblegum, but believe me this is not the strawberry bubblegum scent that you will be expecting for this type of product. Not worth it, go to your local beauty place and get the original stuff."

But I do have skin that is fairly sensitive and that gets dry very easily.  So I figured this couldn't hurt.

The good news is that my skin definitely feels tighter and better moisturized than it has been lately.

The bad news is that the scent is too overpowering for me so I cannot use it regularly.

Great if you don't mind a strong scent.  If, like me that is a deal breaker for you, I'd try something else."
464204,5,"Fabulous. I use after I blow my hair dry when it didn't come out quite the way I wanted it to.  It will straighten out the mess my hair is in the morning so I don't have to wet it and blow dry it everyday.  I like it so much and bought one for my daughter whose often has out of control curly hair."

I also got this one because i thought the pointed tip would make it easier to apply but you have to put it in your hands anyways.  The BB powder is a much better product."

My natural hair is a very thick combination of curls/waves and is very prone to frizz. With this product I was able to maintain a stick straight bob in gummy Wash DC weather, with out excessive use of heat. I found less expensive products that worked well against frizz (garnier smoothing milk) but the Mizani product felt significantly lighter and did not cause product build-up.  It's expensive but it actually works. I purchased it because a friend  flat-ironed my hair using this product and my hair remained sleek even after several days of 90 plus degree weather. In my opinion it is the star product of the Thermasmooth line."

382601,5,"I found this as a sample in a nice hotel in Florida and really liked it, so much that when I got home I ordered more. As a soap in is really no different than anything else less expensive but for the occasional splash in the shower for a fresher and different scent, this isn't too bad. Just ordered my second bottle. Molton Brown has several to choose from, I just liked this the best on a personal level.

551717,5,"I love this product! It actually works!"
436460,4,"I have very sensitive skin, so I have to be careful what types of products I use, especially on my face.  This eye serum/lotion did not irritate my skin at all.  It has a nice subtle scent-it smells fresh with a touch of floral.  It comes out the consistency of a thin lotion and spreads on leaving a silky sheen and feel on the surface of the skin.  A little bit goes a long way-a pea-sized amount provided full coverage for both eye areas (under eyes, to the sides, and on the lids).

I noticed results within the first 2 days of using this.  I have dark circles with faint crows feet on the under/sides of my eyes.  I applied this first at night and when I woke up, the circles were more smooth and less dark by about a shade.  By the second day, the skin around my eyes, where the faint crows feet were, the skin looked fuller and you could barely see the lines.  The improvements continued for 3-5 days and have since plateaued at a nice place-firm skin around the eyes and very minimal circles.

I am not sure how long these results will last when I stop using this cream, but it really does work.  The reason I gave it 4/5 stars is the price-it is currently listed at $125 per 0.5 oz. container.  I do like it, however, I just can't see spending that kind of money regularly especially given this is only for the eyes, it's not designed to even be used on the the other parts of your face.

Overall, it works great, and in this case, it should b/c you may have to sell your first born child to purchase it regularly-however, this stuff will make you look so young no one would believe you've had kids anyway, so there you go ;)"
7803,2,"I'm not going to bash dermablend as this review is my own personal opinion. I did not like how it felt on my face. I felt as though I was wearing a mask not makeup. It does cover well but if you have wrinkles be warned they will show up even more. As I said this is my own opinion, try it yourself and see your own results. I am adding the review today because it wasn't what I expected."

I had tried multiple small curling irons (did I mention my hair is very thick?).  None of them did the job.  I needed a curling iron to simply finish my style, and have it last.  My stylist recommended this brand.  She offered to get it for me when they went on sale.  I was amazed when I saw it on Amazon for such a spectacular price.  This was right before xmas, and I mentioned it to my youngest son.  Who says kids (even adult ones) don't listen?  I got this amazing curling iron and could not be happier.  I expect many ""good hair days"" from what I've experienced so far.  BTW, I use the highest setting because of the thickness of my hair.  I have never had any problems at this temperature.  I would simply caution...know your hair before using."

524685,5,"First let me say for the record: I DID indeed buy this top coat from Amazon. I just didn't buy it on MY Amazon account. I used hubby's Amazon and he has Prime so it was better lol

Now the Review: I went in search of this top coat after a friend sent me a bunch of top coats for me to try out. Among them was a small bottle of CND Air dry. Now I already had a bottle of Seche Vite (pronounced Sa-Shay-veet) and yes it dries SO fast BUT 1. it shrinks away from the edge of the nail, even if you wrap the tips, making wear time of your mani about 5 days. Not good. 2. It SMEARS STAMPING! I waited an hour to top coat my stamped mani, AN HOUR ladies (and gents), and it still smeared!! 3. It STINKS, the smell of Seche gives me a migraine and makes me nauseous smh.

After I cursed a red streak under my breath and banished the Seche to my back up nail bucket, I pulled out the CND Air Dry, the gifted one. I LOVE this stuff! I knew I loved it right away and I knew I was going to need a bigger bottle STAT!

ALL GOOD NO CONS HERE: My bottle arrived sooner than I thought it would, so thank you very much to the seller :o) I purposely waited to do my mani until I had gotten my CND. I was NOT disappointed. It is AWESOME! No shrinking, no smearing, and the dry time may not be under a minute but it is all good to go in about 2 minutes. As with any mani, you shouldn't go hands first into the dishes or gloves for at least an hour. But check out my pics, I wore this mani for a full week with no chipping :o) The only reason why I took it off was because My Holo powder came in the mail as well lol

It's worth the money, and if it is still around when I run out of this bottle then I will purchase another one for sure :o) In my pics three of the nails are painted with all regular polishes, the two that aren't are gel. I was trying to be creative lol

This bottle was a miracle find, as I checked CND's main site and they don't even sell it any more :o( At $10.25 it was a bit pricey, but it is SO well worth the money ladies (and gents)"
91595,4,"This is a very light hold hairspray. Although it says super hold forget it. However it smells wonderful! I use it more as a hair perfume than for the hold. If you need strong hold use this along with another spray. I still love this product."

Whips polish right off, and doesn't overdry nails and cuticles. I am not sure if it works for gel/lacquer polishes, though. And I didn't try it on glitters."
415940,5,"I love that this does not flake or pill on my face.  Feels great in fact, probably because of the moisturizer and hyaluronic acid.  Would have been nice if there had been different tints options, but for liberal application, I still prefer this to white sunscreens that make my face look pasty and ashen.  Will be using this as part of my daily regimen, between moisturizer and makeup."

I only purchased this online because I recognized the original Shampoo Three bottle that's in the picture and thought that's what I was getting but that's not what I received.  It arrived quickly but it was the new formula in the new bottle (which I can buy right down the street for less money).

I can barely see it, and this was the color I wanted the most. The other color that let me down was the deep brown on the bottom left. It's such a deep fall time color but it doesn't stick and seems like it will be hard to blend with.  The highlight on this palette is actually very pigmented, I can tell it's going to last a long time because so little goes such a long way. I think this palette is so perfect for travel because you have 3 products in one. If you are looking for w perfect travel tool, this a great product. If you wanted that gold and deep brim eye shadow, pass on this purchase."

This cleanser stripped my skin so badly that I felt like it was being pulled painfully taut, and using my own serum and then the included Skyn Iceland moisturizer didn't provide me with a comfortable feeling.  I did try the included oil, but it had that unpleasant ""dry oil"" feeling and the whole thing just felt bad.  I re-washed with Bobbi Brown Extra Balm Rinse and followed with my usual skincare (nothing from this kit) and within an hour I was all right.  Am sending this to my sister, who has more oily skin than I do, in hopes she can get some use out of it."

Also, Amazon shipped this bottle in an envelope!!! Really? So when I opened the envelope, the product leaked from the bottle. Basically my ""brand new"" bottle of not-so-cheap shampoo was 1/3 empty :("

548602,5,"Just moved from super-dry-climate Colorado to moist-California and switched to this Cellex-C product as my previous product was a bit too moisturizing.  So far am completely happy with SeaSilk Oil-Free Moisturizer. It's just the right amount of ""help"" for my ""mature"" skin."
57087,1,"I order the procduct came on time but looks like its a fake one the pacake was different and the smell is totally different. I have previously ordered this with different company i was happy this one is duplicate item. I am not in USA right now i am in australaia so i cant even the return the item. I am very disappointed waste of money."
304773,4,"I haven't been using this product for long, and I'm not 100% sure what this is supposed to do exactly (I'll update my review after a couple months), but in combination with the Nioxin Shamp/Conditioner, and the Nioxin Diamax (I'm about to start using the scalp therapy), my hair feels great. It really does make my hair feel a lot thicker, especially at the root.
A few yrs ago, I noticed that my hair, which has always been on the ""fine"" side, was starting to thin around my crown. I was shedding so much, and I was in a panic. I was always feeling my hair, hoping you couldn't see my scalp. Stress, and stopping birth control pills was the cause of my hairloss. I had tests run to rule out other things& got a clean bill of health.
I started using the Nioxin prods and after about a month I realized that my hair had started to thicken up where it was looking really thin before. It worked SO well that I wasn't worrying about my hair at all anymore! I purchased the largest bottles of Nioxin that you can get, so it lasted me for a long time, I only had to replace the Diamax a few x's. Once I ran out of things, I switched to a different hair care prod, and went about my business. Recently stress took over again, and I started noticing that my hair had started thinning again, and I realized that I hadn't been using the Nioxin. I won't make that mistake again. I've added this Booster to my regimen, because I figured it won't hurt.
I know I'm not talking about the Intensive Therapy Booster specifically, because I feel like the Nioxin prods work in unison with each other. I can't say enough great things about Nioxin and what it does for my hair, and my confidence. Being a woman in my 30's--thinning hair is NOT OK! I can totally sympathize with anyone else that is dealing with this issue. My dad is a dermatologist, and he deals with patients with thinning hair a lot, and besides a few drugs, there's not much that can be done..yet. I hope that pretty soon there will be better treatments out there for us. Until then-I'm keeping stocked up on this!"

180086,1,"I purchased the 1.5"" model as a Christmas gift thinking that I was getting her a salon quality curling iron that would last a long time.  It quit working after less than 5 months.  The seller offered warranty replacement if we pay return shipping.  But for the cost of shipping we can buy a Revlon curling iron at Walmart.  Her last Revlon lasted much longer than this so-called salon quality curling iron.  Thanks but no thanks!  Do not purchase this curling iron and expect it to last a long time."
345278,4,"Love this product!  I use it before and after I blow dry and style my hair.  I love that I can apply a lot of this and go to sleep with it and it not look oily in the morning.  It really tames fly-aways and diminishes the look of my split ends."
167593,5,"Hair spray has great all day hold.  My friend gave me her bottled.  I loved it so I purchased one on amazon.  Fast shipping and good packaging."

117076,5,"Great for eczema, I was recommended to use this by my dermatologist after having a flair up."
308978,5,"My barber (who is one of the most well-known in Chicago) told me my hair was drying out, so I shouldn't wash it everyday or I would damage it. I tried not washing it everyday, and it wasn't bad. The problem is, when I use product, go to the gym or do other forms of exercise, my hair begins to look greasy if I just rinse thoroughly with water after. He had mentioned it was the sulfates in shampoos that caused drying, so I went another route and decided to try this sulfate-free shampoo. You better believe I thought a long while before I was going to pay 17 bucks for a shampoo. I mean, that's usually how much I pay for shampoo and conditioner in 3-4 years (I was using the big Pantene Pro-V bottles).
This stuff is worth every penny. Using it everyday with conditioner, I noticed my hair was never dry after use and at the end of the day it would be oily again. I was happy with this, since it meant my hair wasn't dry throughout the day and I made it to the end of the day looking clean. Much like everyone says, use a small amount. I use a pea size dab and lather it in my hands before applying it. If it isn't enough on a particular day, I just add a little bit more. The way it smells is also great. It has a subtle masculine smell that isn't overpowering at all. I almost want to give this 4 stars just because of the price, but because it only requires a small amount, you get a lot of bang for your buck.
If you're a guy who's looking for a great shampoo, I highly recommend this. For a woman, if scent matters to you, you may not like it."

181491,1,"Bought this, sent it back the same day. I was coming from a croc straightener that broke.. well I turned right around and bought another croc. This was horrible! I have thick kinky curly hair. For one, it's so thin that the handle gets so hot after only 15 minutes of being on that I couldn't even pick it up to straighten my hair! When I tried to work through it, I burnt the tips of my fingers. For two, this straighter does not close tight! And it's so hot you can't get your hand up far enough for that good seal. It made my hair look like straw."

381174,5,"I recently discovered butter London nail color and I love how absolutely easy it is to apply myself, so when I needed some single use remover to take when traveling, I decided to suck it up and pay the higher price to try their product. The scrubbers are much more effective than other ""pads"" I have used. They were fully saturated with remover and, most importantly, one scrubber removed 2 coats of nail hardener, 1 base coat, 2 coats of dark blue polish, and a top coat-- with no trouble whatsoever, and no left over smears on my cuticles. Very effective.

I am hopeful that these will remain moist over time. A common problem for me with single use remover pads is that, since I use them mostly when I travel, they tend to sit around for a while.  Most tend to dry up over time, even though they are sealed in lined packets. I will try to come back and report how these hold up.

At twice the price of standard pads, you will have to make the call for yourself, but if you like to wear dark, saturated nail color, these really work. I don't use them often so the additional cost is not a deal-breaker for me."
155860,5,"When applied at first inkling of a cystic breakout, this product truly works wonders.  It prevents the cyst from becoming gigantic and unsightly and prevents the ugly scarring that comes with this type of acne.

345189,4,"I use this 3x's a week and have seen some slight improvement. I started with the settings at the lowest and worked my way up. Eventually I got to the last setting and am hoping I can still see some more benefits but I may have reached the max, still trying though. Coconut oil works good if you don't want to keep using the fatgirl cream."
107393,5,"this is my favorite wash for my baby. It leaves my baby skin soft and well moisturized,and the smell is great. Definetly a quality product. The lotion is also great!!"

484364,5,"I love this brush so much, I have given three as gifts!"
241221,2,"Is concealer worked great cause coverage wise. However,  getting it off and applying it were both difficult.  It was like drawing on my face with a crayon.  I had to return this due to that."
188414,5,"Got this for my wife.  She spends like 2 hours in the bathroom getting ready to go places.  Was looking for something to speed up the process and last longer than the 5 other dryers she's gone through over the years.  It's not loud and dries her hair in record time and she's very happy with it.  Doesn't get really hot from what she's told me and doesn't effect the quality of her hair in a bad way that is.  I would recommend it to anyone that's willing to pay a little more for a good product which in the end saves you a lot of time."
572704,5,"Amazing product and thanks for ontime shipping"
352680,3,"A bit disappointed after hearing great reviews. I'm fair skinned and this was lighter than I expected and didn't cover as well either, although I wasn't looking for that as much as for a deeper color tan.  The scent is nice, not bothersome and I didn't have any issue with the color transferring onto clothes.  The buff after one use was already starting to pill, but doesn't seem to be a problem.  Overall wish I'd done better research."
63116,5,"A few years ago I found this product in New York. I was amazed, only a few, small drops (I use a small pump flask, two pumps each side) massaged in the shower-wet beard and shaving ends with amazing smooth result - I do not use any other shaving foam. Well I have not found this product here in Finland but amazon makes it possible - I use 2 bottles of this product a year."
377819,4,"I like this product a lot. It goes on very smooth and so far hasn't bothered my very sensitive skin. My only complaint is that it is a bit too dark for me right now since it's winter and I'm at my fairest. I think it is a great color that would be good on a lot of skin tones though and I know it will be perfect once I have just a bit more color."
297271,2,"I tried the littlest dab I could possibly put on my fingers to apply to my hair and it still made my hair yucky feeling and looking!  In all honesty though, it must be my hair because all hair products seem to do similar things. I much prefer nothing at all even though it is then kind of ""fly away"". I was looking for something that would not change the look but just kind of hold it in place. This makes it look matted down."
247374,5,"Works really good on oily skin. It had helped my skin to look more natural and reduce the oily feeling and looking."
90557,1,"Beware - there is NO RETURN POLICY. I was stupid enough to believe this would provide a great shave and had my wife buy the razor for me. I wound up using my Gillette Fusion afterwards to actually get a clean shave. SAVE YOUR MONEY."
133636,5,"Really works.  Simply sprinkle on your scalp and watch the ""bareness"" disappear.  Easy to use.  Does not make hair sticky."

170501,5,"Mario Badescu products are tried and true, and what I love about them are the ingredients - never harsh but get the job done.
I love the way my face feels after using this and I have seen a slight reduction in some fine lines around my mouth when used in conjuction with Mario Badescu Cellufirm drops mixed with Primrose oil."
134627,2,"When I found Abba Pure Moisture Shampoo on sale at Harmon, I was excited because of the rave reviews here on Amazon. However, the only thing I like about it is the yummy peppermint scent. My hair is Type 4, and it did not work well for me."

554195,4,"Smelled like rancid corn oil after a bit."
284314,5,"I received a Lily eau de toilette for Christmas last year and I absolutely love it! It's the perfect light fragrance for everyday wear, and not overwhelmingly floral/grandma-aromatic like some of the other C&E scents. It's versatile and appropriate for any age. Many negative reviews are based on the expectation of a totally different product line, Lily of the Valley. I'm sure I would be disappointed too, but without that bias, I think it's a great scent. My only gripe is that is isn't very long lasting, so I keep the solid perfume version in my bag to reapply."
295652,5,"It is the real thing.... best price and smells excellent"
371728,5,"This really, truly works!  My lash length doubled and are darker and my sparse eyebrows have made a come back  ^5 .  I hope they don't stop making this. This is working better for me than LiLash, at less than 1/2 the price.  I didn't experience any negative effects .  My daughter's lashes are longer and darker but she felt slight tingling or itching the first few days of use.  She likes the results of her upper eylashes but has stopped using ion her bottom lashes because it was darkening the lash line skin. I thought that was a plus, like faint eyeliner. I wish it did that for me."
67534,5,"This product revitalizes hair and also smells great! I have been using this for years."
358982,5,"This is a great complement to the GrandeLASH-MD serum.  It highlights my light eyelashes easily, without clumping, defining and lengthening each lash individually.  It gives a more natural look than many mascaras I have used in the past."
58518,5,"I absolutely love this moisturizer and have seen noticeable improvement in the quality of my skin.  I can't wait to try other Bioelements products."
29781,5,"Beautiful Color! Mint is perfect for summer and the product is all natural, you cant go wrong! I'm addicted. Perfect!!"

412894,5,"Great at cleaning the beard!"

68117,5,"I have been using gloMinerals for a very long time.  This powder is great and really covers small imperfections.  You only need to put a little bit of the powder on your face brush, it goes a long way.  The first time I used this powder, I really rubbed my brush into it and wasted quite a bit of the powder.  I will continue to order and use this makeup - very easy to toss in my purse and freshen up after work if going out to meet friends for the evening."
482788,5,"Item received matched description."
338374,5,"Ordered color BB5, and received BB3.  A replacement was sent quickly the next day, but still the wrong color, BB3.

Update 05/14:  Amazon has resolved the issue with the incorrect color, and I ordered again and got the correct BB5.  The product is great, a little heavy but gives great coverage and blends easily.  I like the yellowish tone in the BB5; I'm very fair and the yellow seems to offset the blue veins that are sometimes visible.  It is expensive, but I use only a few dabs each morning so it lasts."
211817,3,"The color is gorgeous, but the polish is thin needs three coats to completely cover. Too bad it's not a bit thicker"
295498,5,"Great product was very happy with it and with the shipping service."
260975,2,"packaging was terrible...so bad that I returned because I did not feel good about giving it as a Christmas gift.  I wanted this one to save money on a diffuser, because this one comes with one, but all parts are rattling about int he box, the box was damaged, and it just did not look the price.  Spend $27 more for the V1 and you get what you pay for.  Love that one!"
475182,5,"Love this balm"

213829,3,"Great color and applies smoothly but chips very easily."
383908,5,"I'm a guy and when I first tried this (squeezed it out of the tube) I thought 'yuck' as it felt like a lotion and not like a cleanser at all. But I rubbed my hands together as directed and sure enough it turned into a nice foamy lather that seems to clean well (I have slightly oily skin and many cleansers just don't feel as though they're really getting the job done). I was surprised at the amount of lather (I'll use less from here on out) and what a nice smell it had, in that it has a really mild scent that disappears almost immediately.

I was also surprised at just how 'strong' it was. When I rinse it off my skin feels as though every tiny bit of oil is gone and I remain surprised at just how little an amount you need to squeeze out to get a bunch of lather.

So I like it. Do I like it $25 for a 4 oz tube enough. I don't think so, but on sale I'd probably buy it. And to be fair, I might anyway, as a very small amount foams up to be far more (and works well) than I expected, so I keep reducing the amount I need to use, which means this may last longer than I thought. I'm hoping that the $25 is an intro price and that it goes down because as I get used to it I don't want to give it up."
359283,1,"This is not a real Oribe product. This bottle arrived with some other oil in it. It does not even smell like signature Oribe products!"
491167,5,"Teeth nice and white"
3378,5,"My favorite summer color!"
318759,1,"This product didn't work for me at all and was a total waste of money, very disappointing for how expensive it was. I have very oily skin and this left a white film on my face. I'm on the fence about whether to try the regular Coola sunscreen."
331722,5,"Great foundation, perfect concealer, but the brush sucks for applicating foundation.
I used it for contouring like the Nars brush. Its better for that.
Would highly recommend it :)"
7588,5,"I love love love Dermablend! I used to purchase at our local mall, but why go and fight traffic when you can have delivered straight to your home. This product is a full coverage foundation that I use as a concealer. Believe me it works.... I have some dark problem areas on my face in the dimples area. All I do is pat not rub,  a small amount and poof they disappear. I use the setting powder too. My 73 yr old mom uses as a foundation and looks great."
293068,5,"Perfect set!"
531549,5,"I have really dry scalp and skin. This spray gives moisture and smells great. I recommend trying this out."
278297,1,"Pretty sure this is a knockoff.  I've been a long time user of Strivectin.  I use it as a night cream for my face.  This product feels thinner and it also does not have the strong pepperminty smell that my normal Strivectin has.  It also did not have the silver safety seal.  Will be returning."
44295,4,"I've had the straightener a short amount of time and so far its working just fine and gets very hot. My only issue is that I hate how it feels 'gliding' over my hair. I wouldn't even really call it a glide. The plates kind of pull over the hair instead of gliding smoothly. Still, its pretty good for a 40 dollar straightener."
306638,5,"This eyeshadow truly lived up to my expectations. Has a great pigmentation and wonderful texture. I will definitely be trying other Balm products."
345199,3,"I just received it about a week ago and was waiting to see results before writing a review. So far it's a good start!  My problem areas are my inner thighs and had noticed cellulite starting (slight dimples) on my outter thighs. When I saw this machine I figured I should try it before spending on other costly alternatives. I am seeing slow results in the milder areas and I'm waiting for more results in the more challenging areas. I am using the Lean Machine twice a day every day  in addition to my 3 times a week workout at the gym so we shall  see. I will repost another review in a couple of months.

Pros: Cost effective, clear instructions and clearly explains how it works, it comes with a cream (more on that in the Con section), variety of speeds, can use it on your stomach (or on your back with help), rechargeable

Cons: It takes more than 3 minutes to get through one entire leg but if you are targeting a small specific area 3 minutes would be understandable, the cream doesn't really help the machine to glide as much as I would have liked but no problem. Here is my advice: 1. add the cream first, massage it in and then add a thin layer of baby oil to help glide. I did this until the sample lotion finished  2. The sample lotion lasted a week and noticed the cream is a bit pricey for its quantity. My advice I got a Jergen's Skin Firming lotion for a lot cheaper and it is designed to tighten and firm so perfect combo.

Overall, I think it's a good first step to targeting cellulite or the beginning stages of it. I would recommend this product."
45410,4,"it's a little heavy, but other than that, awesome."
531525,3,"I'm sure this is a nice quality soap but it had a very strong floral fragrance - not at all like wood smoke - in fact it was so strong I had to return it."
304904,2,"For my mixed/oily skin is a no no.  I am sure it is great for people with dry skin, but for me it just caused the pores to clog up and break out."
36704,3,"We run our hair dryer a lot and this one will run from hot to cool without you touching anything which does not work for what we use it for."
491369,2,"OPI Pants on Fire is NOT like it's pictured.  It's a very very bright neon orange.  Buyer FYI. From the picture, the polish looks like a pumpkin color.  Wrong."
531902,5,"Loved it"
154894,5,"I read mixed reviews so I took a chance. I'm glad I did! I'm blonde with gray. I love this! Will buy again! I can go day two with my hair down! I have limp hair and it gives my hair body all day long which is hard to do my hair normally falls flat in 30 min. The smell is actually great compare to the other products I tried.  The reviews said to put on fingers then apply to roots. I did that at first worked great! But then I put it on my scalp and that work awesome as well. Definitely recommend."
146684,4,"Love that this has temperature controls. I have fine hair and high-temp tools fry it. The titanium is smooth and eliminates frizz. My only complaint is that the cord is super long and gets tangled easily. Other than that, I love it!"
327343,5,"This product works sooooo good! I use it every night after I get out of the shower and it really helps nourish my nails under the shellac, as well as my cuticles and all the other ugly hang nails and such around my nails. It smells really good too!"
493489,2,"The bottom of the glass jar was partially filled. The fragrance was good."
361703,1,"Absolute fake-do not purchase"
253523,1,"I took a gamble ordering this after reading all the reviews stating that its not authentic. I thought no way Amazon would be selling an inauthentic product. I was wrong. I own this product from my ipsy bag and Ive been using this brand of eyeliner for years. I ordered this to keep one in my purse and one at home, since I already have one. This product is nothing like the product Ive been using forever. Its watery, runny, has poor pigmentation  barely worth $5, much less $20. In these pictures you can clearly see the difference between the authentic Stay All Day, which is on the top, and this product. I was so shocked because the packaging itself looks real so I examined it super closely to look for differences. Its barely noticeable, but the font on this product is much thicker than the font on the authentic product. Im beyond disappointed in this purchase and I won't be making the mistake of buying brand name beauty products from amazon again. Overall, don't waste your money. This isn't real. Just go order it from Sephora."
395960,4,"I love this product!!  It actually does what it says it will!  What a concept!  THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR THIS PRODUCT!!"

401661,5,"Arrived ahead of schedule. Wife opened it and was delighted."
96861,4,"This works on everything with keratin, nails, too."
351656,5,"Awesome product."
116394,5,"i absolutely love this color! i have worn it now for about 2 months straight. i cant find a better purple!
i have a teal that i go back and forth on but this is always my color i go back to - always happy with it."
539266,1,"I like this brand and works great! However the package was open, the item was new and no signs of usage have been found.... but next time I will buy this item in a different place."
84126,5,"I just love this candy smell. Not too kiddish and not over powering. I use it daily and like the perfume but the body wash is just so-so."
136891,1,"Before I even open the lid, I can already see the dry spilled clay on the container. The seal was opened, and there was a huge chunk of dry clay on the inside of the lid. Very disappointed!"
485306,4,"I have been using Longcils Boncza cake mascara in brown for many years, but it didn't look good with the navy blue eyeliner I've been into lately. I wanted to try a different brand in black, so I bought the MadLash mascara. It's a lovely black that stays on all day. It doesn't easily smudge, but is a real bitch to get off. I use my olive and castor cleansing oil and I still have to 'scrub' a bit. I'd rather have that than smeary makeup though, so it's a trade off. I find that it's a bit clumpy, and I read that adding a couple drops of saline solution (eye drops) would help out, so I will give that a try and see if it helps. ***UPDATE**** The saline solution did help with clumps, as well as running a dry spoolie through my lashes after application."
154407,2,"The oil was too thick...it did not work well for my hair."
314052,5,"I love this fun red multi-color with silver sparkles from OPI's 2011 Muppet Collection.  I use this polish as an accent when I want to paint a few fingers surrounding a neutral color."
392571,2,"It does what it supposed to.  Everybody is different and this one doesn't do a spectacular job for my face.
The white container one is a little better and this one is for some reason not as slick to my face."
26987,1,"Loved the silver color but didn't give the coverage I was looking for. Needs multiple coats to achieve desired look."
32204,5,"Works great!"
565623,5,"This is the best eyeliner I have ever used. I pray they never stop making it."
131163,5,"I love this stuff. I use it every day at the crown of my head where I have some thin spots. My hair is very dark so my pale scalp skin shows through where my hair has thinned due to menopause. I just sprinkle a bit of Toppik on my sparse areas and use a bit of hair spray. You can't even tell that my hair is thin where the Toppik has been applied. Great stuff!"
129783,3,"Good product."
405222,5,"Gets rid of my red circles when don't get enough sleep"
356379,5,"love this product, doesn't  make your hair stiff. Your hair is nice and soft but yet curly"
250960,5,"This is the best eyelash curler I have ever used! Super compact to fit in my makeup bag and makes my lashes look huge!"
94780,5,"I have tried various ZEN-TAN lotions now and they all work excellently.  This one has a vanilla scent, masking any chemical smell there may be.  The pump lotion comes out a medium brown and absorbs quickly into the skin.  The result is a very natural and even tan.  This works well around the face when properly applied."
410003,4,"love this stuff.... goes on easy, stays on, and adds just the right color.  And Amazon has an excellent price."
292020,3,"Not sure how or when to use it."
340817,5,"All the Paul Mitchell Curls products came in large sized tubes that ran into a lot of money when combined. But I like the way the stuff feels and works. And no one aroujnd here sells it. I got samples. Liked them. But no one carried them, so I figured a larger size pkg and a little more money would go along way. It did."
250757,4,"I purchased this curler because of the other reviews.  I have an eye condition that has caused a band a scar tissue on my eyelid which makes my lashes point straight out.  These are the first ones I've tried that actually work and they're constructed in such a way that it doesn't pinch.  Very pleased."
493401,5,"Good stuff"
208584,5,"works well"
143049,5,"Love it! The smell reminds me of old fashioned baby dolls and it feels good spraying it on"
555928,5,"My favorite cologne for my husband"
142157,5,"This stuff smells amazing! My skin tends to dry out after a full day so I'll spray this on over my makeup to add some moisture back in. I'll also use it on occasion pre-makeup for added moisture. Need a smaller bottle for travelling- feel like this would be great for flying in a dry airplane cabin. Also, I have sensitive skin and this fragrance doesn't bother me!"
235836,5,"This product was found by searching for a product to reduce these encrusted skin barnacles they would bleed if I scratched them.  I have been using for about a couple of weeks and have seen a remarkable reduction on my hands and arms.  My ankles had several barnacles and it is taking longer but with the kit comes a scrubber that helps with getting them softer.  I am pleased with the product and recommend them to all those ""seasoned citizens"" who I as have this condition handed down from my mother.  By the way I am a 66 year old male who never thought of hydrating his skin or use any type of lotions except for sunscreens."
292765,5,"My hair is fine and shoulder length.  Tends to be very flat.  This does give it a good lift in the exact place where you spray it.  The reason I like it over other products is because it LASTS.  Great for second day hair.  The smell is nice too, I do not find it over powering."
220079,5,"DRYER IS A VERY HIGH QUALITY"
530236,5,"This organizer has been amazing!!  No more burnt spots on my daughter's vanity or bedspread from the straightener!!"
356259,5,"Perhaps the most beautiful baby blue I've ever seen. Love it."
496831,4,"Received as described."
549236,5,"Everything was fine"
31847,5,"Best hairspray ever.  It holds and lasts, decreases friz, but isn't painfully too strong."
369942,1,"WOW!  you must have to use with CND polish i used w/OPI and it sucked!  Smeared, went on thick, lasted 2 days tops.
will not purchase again.  Sally Hansen much cheaper buy local lasts a lot longer."
318466,5,"Love it"
98069,5,"My second one. I love it that it doesn't clog pores. No paraben, etc. Love it."
81585,5,"BEST LIP BALM EVER"
33288,5,"I really like this cream and I will definitely purchase again!!!"
462371,5,"I am a novice to contouring and this kit is a very good place for a newbie to start. It's much easier to control versus a cream contour kit and I am slowly getting a handle on the overall application process. Quality makeup."
429708,3,"It feels like a nice scrub for your face. After use, my pores and lines, etc are all the same. I look a bit flushed, rosy and have a clean face. However, you can get this effect from any facial scrub. I use mine daily/second daily as I think twice daily is too abrasive. The best bit is that there are no external batteries so you don't have to worry where the water splashes, and you get a lot of uses out of 1 charge (= approx 20 uses). I use any liquid face wash as long as it isn't grainy.

In my opinion, overall not worth the price. I kind of fell for the hype.

It's important for buyers to note that the head can be detached. Depending on what liquid cleanser you use, you can get crud build up behind the head, so it is important to clean out. I use a soap to wash the head once a week and let it air dry. Once a month, I soak the head in rubbing alcohol for a few hours. If I break out in acne, I increase the frequency of sterilisation. Don't forget to make sure the alcohol is rinsed out well - I do it x3 prior to use (otherwise it burns!!!) So far, the original head has lasted me close to a year. The bristles are intact, except 1 which is starting to become a bit loose.

If you can afford it, great. Otherwise, I not a holy grail product for me."
147669,5,"Works very well. Gets very hot and curls like it's supposed to."
347879,5,"good item"
179177,4,"Great straightener!"

56292,5,"fantastic scent super masculine chics love the way it smells on me"
138056,5,"I like this product very much. Have only used it for a month &plan to continue to use it."
567626,5,"These are, no lie, the best nail polishes i have bought. I was a little nervous about buying them offline from amazon without seeing them first but they were one of the pre-christmas holiday deals and it couldn't be passed up. If i'm being honest, the plan initially was to give these individually out as gifts but as soon as they came in, I had to try them. The color goes on smoothly and evenly and they dry relatively quickly. Yes they have a little bit of ""sparkle"" but the result doesn't really look shiny or glittery, it's almost just more textured or 3D.

I did also buy the sleeping garden trio set and was equally as happy with those, though they are definitely a little more laid back and cool"
59536,5,"This stuff is awesome!  I have a hard time finding products that will make my coarse hair feel soft and this one does it!  I spray my hair after a shower and after it's dried my hair is much softer and less frizzy.  It's not perfect hair but def a noticeable improvement."
468704,5,"Great stuff!! Just be sure to use a very small amount"
234946,5,"This stuff is amazing. I had been using the more expensive KP duty product for about a year. It helped some, but I still didn't have perfect smooth arms. After using this product for about a week, I am almost there!"
73316,5,"lovely face wash leaves it moisturized and clean."
85647,5,"i received it thinking it was bigger because usually you need a lot of remover to take of polish but this remover is amazing you barley need any for both of your hands. I will definantly be repurchasing this product!"
188029,5,"great"
267841,5,"Always remember to go EASY with these discs. You'll see the dry skin flying off and it's so tempting to press hard and go over and over the same area. This product is well madden arrives quickly,"
366808,5,"I discovered this eye makeup remover through Birchbox and now swear I can't use anything else. It works quickly and efficiently and doesn't leave even a tiny inch of dryness."
140597,5,"Smells good and seems to make my skin feel and look good!"
192714,5,"Makes my hair silky and it smells so good, love it"
239304,5,"I have been using the product for years.  It gives my hair just the right amount of shine, curl and support."
466176,5,"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING WOW!!!!!! So my hair is very very thick and course so not a whole lot of natural shine and glow. But when I spray this on my hair, it instantly shines it up. I recommend this to anybody, your hair will look beautiful!"
417866,5,"Truly gives lots of volume after shampooing,  Nice smell as well,"
125070,5,"I am a huge believer in this Japanese product.  It keeps my usually dry hands all winter long.  I put it on my cuticles to keep them looking good too.  Very expensive and I usually don't spend on products like this, but it lasts a very long time and to me well worth it."
565387,5,"Nate"
272488,1,"Not a fan. I sprayed it on one section of my hair and it immediately was so tangled I actually had to wash the product out in order to comb through that section again. I'll probably give it one more chance before I throw the entire bottle away, but first try - no luck. It is super sticky, like hair spray."

37287,5,"This is one of the only products that did not irritate or aggravate my newborn's skin. Eczema runs in the family so I had bought a bunch of eczema products including products by Aveeno. This is the only one that didn't make the problem worse. Has relatively low rating on EWG which is comforting."
534650,5,"Have been using this volume foam for about 5 years now.  Work great on my short, fine hair.  Love it...and was so glad to find it on Amazon!"

133814,5,"From the age of sixteen, my hair has been thinning drastically - I have tried EVERYTHING to stop/hide/conceal such an embarrassing trait, since hair is one of the most notable physical attributes of being a female :(  I used to go to JA Alternatives to get hair ""tied"" to the root of my own, and have tried every type of extension; and currently use expensive Aveda/top of the line products to stop damage, take stress pills, biotin, etc. etc. but THIS PRODUCT seriously has worked the best!!.

On the thinner areas, you apply this product, which has natural building fibers (usually to your part at the top of your head) and the fibers rest on top of the ""white"" (or whatever scalp color) patches and literally ""fill it in"", then use a spritz of hairspray to hold.. it'll stay fit all day long, and it doesn't look fake, at ALL; feel weird, or make your natural hair oily/dry/damaged.  It also comes off with shampoo the next time you decide to wash -

The only really lame thing about this product is you kind of start getting addicted to it. :(  Once you've seen your hair with it, when you get out of the shower and see how thin your hair actually is, it's morbidly depressing- lol.  And it's kind of pricey!!!.

Either way, I give two thumbs way up :D hope this helps"
320511,1,"The cap was broken!"
495521,5,"I ordered this because Ive been having sinus problems and thought it would help. And it does!!  I soak with this in my bath and I haven't had to use vapor rub. Another reason I ordered is because it is a bath oil and not a bubble bath. In my jet tub it does create a small amount of bubbles, but its worked out great."
504195,5,"like it"
452675,5,"Nothing"
541573,1,"I just used this product for couple days and right now area around eyes swelling, burning and red , some ingredient in the that cream I am allergic too. And I been used before other companies but never have like this allergic reaction ever."

276583,5,"great"
246464,2,"Bought this beginning of April... Today I turned it on and little plastic pieces shot out and now it doesn't work.  Gave it 2 stars because when it did work it worked well.. Quality of item is below standard that I would expect for a $129 hairdryer..."

83735,4,"This is something my wife wanted for Christmas. It smells good."
538141,5,"I could not be happier with the Pur Cosmetic line. I am 40 and have had acne all my life (it's awful). I used Este Lauder since college and face never looked good. I accidently bought the foundation at an Ulta store and in in two weeks my face started to clear up. I ditched all my Este Lauder products and am strictly using Pur. I start with this cleaner (which is amazing). It has a cooling sensation and I have clear skin now! It's made a world of difference for me and my daughter. I follow up with the Ceretin Serum and their moisture lotion with Pur foundation, powder and blush. I also use the mud mask once a week. My skin looks better every day."

54170,5,"Seems like the real deal."
176068,5,"I love this stuff! It smells heavenly. I love to use it right after a shower and I also use it to set my makeup and it does a really nice job :-)"
34034,5,"A great shaving cream. I love the menthol tingle. The tube was actually bigger than I expected, and will last a very long time since you only need a pea-sized amount if you're using a shaving brush (as you should be). Works up a very nice lather in a hurry."
489633,5,"I love this product. Its a gentle wash and smells great.  I use this primarily for my daughters hair but can be used for the body as well. Excellent product."
444185,5,"Smells like peaches"
415320,5,"Really helps my dry overprocessed hair"
75444,5,"Great price, shipped on time!"
16108,5,"Great moisturizer, prescribed by my dermatologist.  It is very light and good for oily skin. Not good enough for the winter and recommended to use heavier lotion overnight."
513796,4,"This is not great as a primary deodorant stick; which is to say, it doesn't work all that great to keep you from stinking all through the day. I use a normal unscented drugstore deodorant (usually dove) in the morning, and in hot summer days, use this when I get home for a cooling, fresh feeling and a bit of a fresh scent. It has that lovely crisp verbena scent L'Occitane is known for, and I find that after a long day of working out or gardening it is lovely to be able to use this to freshen up and remove any odor I may have picked up during the day."
334669,5,"This item works great for me. It has a tingly feeling that feels really nice when applied with my badger shaving brush. It is a great product and would last a long time as you only need a few swirls on your shaving brush. I apply this directly onto my face as it has an instant lather effect with my shaving brush.  I do not ""mix"" a batch of lather in a separate bowl. The blade glides off of this soap very smoothly. Try it, and if you are into tube shaving creams, you can reuse the bowl when the product inside is finished to mix up a great larher! Enjoy!"
341977,4,"It's matte and stays on for many hours. I just don't like the shade selections. I bought Hazel. This shade would match after I have darkened in the  late summer if I don't wear sunblock. It matched me last summer. It's too dark for winter and spring. I tried mixing this with the lighter, ""chamomile"" shade, which turned out to be a very bad mixture. lol Don't even do it, it'll look orange.
I don't like that it doesn't blend well with other shades.
I'll use it as leg makeup in the summer to use it up.  I would not buy this again, only because it doesn't match me. I have yellow-olive undertones.  This is sort of orange-ish."
462173,5,"Being a mascara ""junky"" didn't expect that much...... but I love it!! Can't imagine just using one brand but I am sure thinking of sticking with Lorac"
350486,5,"Love it!"
316723,1,"I had this dryer for 2 months before it died. Do not buy this product."
130629,5,"Learned about this product from someone, and quickly made the purchase.  It works great on my wigs for effortless styling."
283542,3,"A pretty pale shade of pink that is usable, but not what I had hoped for. The bottle color does not accurarely represent the finished color. The bottle shows a rich, opaque, dusty rose and even with two coats it finishes to a pale pink that is quite sheer or see-through. Trying to find just the right pink and this wasn't it, but it'll be a good natural look."
528838,5,"Love this sunblock. Gives great coverage but cannot be used over makeup for reapplication."
8047,5,"I started using Dermablend when I had my thyroid removed. It covered up the scar nicely but I have since discovered that it is an excellent makeup and use it frequently."
392091,5,"I love this hand lotion. It is costly but I love the results."
468572,5,"It is hard to give a true review after only using a product like this for a few days but here are the current results after a few days use.

The Vichy cream is nicely packaged.  The jar comes in a square box to protect the jar.  The jar is 2 tall and 3 wide.  It was fully filled.  We have had some other brands in the past that make a large container but only fill the jar half way.  Very nice packaging by Vichy.

The cream goes on very smooth and appears to be moisturizing my skin nicely.  The cream is a very smooth filling moisturizer.

Per the packaging:  This cream is for post-menopausal aging. The cream is for fragile, thinning skin with extreme dryness. This is for normal to dry skin.

I will update as more time goes by.  At this time I am very happy with the feel and texture of this cream and I am very happy with the results so far.  I have had NO side effects."
419557,5,"This moisturizing serum is amazing. I use it for my face and it works like a charm. My face gets sun spots from time to time and this helps clear it. I love this product."
168192,5,"Once in a while when I apply my night time routine of Vit C followed by Hyaluronic Acid, it makes my face sting and burn.  When that happens I can spray my face with Avene Thermal Spring Water and it takes the burn out.  I am very impressed!  This is what I was hoping would happen and it did.  Cool and refreshing!"
443117,3,"Gentle shampoo. Leaves my hair soft and silky. However, does not clean well. My hair is dirty/greasy within a day or two."
178492,5,"I use this to spiral curl all 3 of my daughter's hair a few times a week.  The curls last for a few days on my daughter with thick hair (I do use hairspray in conjunction with it), my daughter with thin hair it usually lasts through the day (as log as she doesn't take  one of her signature sweaty naps).  I get compliments on their hair all the time!"
399180,4,"I liked the older version (for wizards) better but this is still great stuff."
438420,2,"This is the third Paul Mitchell straightener I have purchased that has stopped working in a little over a year for no reason. These products are expensive and have a terrible reputation for breaking for good reason.  While the straightener itself works well, it's not worth it to have to purchase a new one every year. I will be researching new brands based on the fact that this is the third one I bought that broke shortly after."
235350,5,"I was using Cetaphyl but it dried out my skin. I have been using Glytone with a Olay Pro brush and haven't had any major breakouts. Great prouct!"
309786,4,"Good stuff. It will mess with your eyes if you get it on your hand and touch your eye at all!"
110003,5,"Can't believe It took me so long to discover this stuff. I will never shave again without it. As a black male in the military I have to stay clean shaven but its such a hassle. Using this twice a day practically prevents any razor bumps from ever forming. No its not perfect, but if you haven't tried this yet its well worth it."
526495,5,"smells amazing!"
466245,4,"This is a very subtle water based perfume that is perfect for going out but won't last more than a few hours.  The scent is is more flowery and less citrusy and we really like it.  The bottle is very aesthetically pleasing  and at first I thought the cloth Icoste was logo was a bit strange on a glass bottle but it's actually quite striking.  This would make a great gift for a younger wearer who is in to trendy things."
553649,5,"strong hold but doesn't look like you have gel in your hair"
166053,2,"Container only half filled."
129196,3,"I purchased this dryer about four years ago when I was still in college, and I just finally threw it away today.  Overall, it was just okay, and I don't think it was worth the price. The two settings (high and low) were annoying because the high was much too high and I always felt like my face was being blasted off.  However, the low wasn't very powerful.  I just pulled out my old Conair ion shine dryer (from 6 or 7 years ago!) and it dried my bangs much faster this morning.  Plus, my Conair is much smaller, the Bio Ionic was pretty big.

I had originally bought this dryer based on a recommendation from my stylist at the time.  I have very fine hair that easily breaks...it is very high maintenance.  There was no noticeable difference in breakage using this dryer, and eventually I stopped blow drying the majority of my hair altogether.  Now I just do the bangs.

About a year and a half ago the plastic cover for the part that goes into the outlet cracked on my bio ionic.  I had to be very careful with it and not unplug it or else the connection would break and the dryer wouldn't turn on.  However, yesterday I finally had to unplug it and it fell apart.  The prongs are too askew to go into the outlet, and the plastic part fully came off.  I did have the dryer for two and a half years before the original cracking happened, though.  Just wasn't long enough considering what I paid for it overall, but I guess most items don't last hat long these days anyways."
355735,5,"I'm very fair and have a lot of redness on my face, and this foundation managed to cover up the redness and not look too obvious. I'd probably prefer one shade lighter if that were an option just because in the bright light, Ivory can still appear a little unnaturally dark. It looks perfectly fine in normal indoor-lighting, however.

The texture is similar to cake icing or mousse, so it feels very soft and spreads easily. It is also extremely pigmented, so it's easy to use too much and get a ""cakey"" texture - after the first or second time applying, you learn really quickly that you only need a little bit. This is a huge plus to me.

I experimented with using my fingers to apply it, and a foundation brush, and a make-up sponge. The brush was ok, but I felt like a lot of the foundation got caught in the hairs. The sponge had the best results, in my opinion, and I felt my face looked more even in tone than if I used my fingers. My t-zone tends to get oily throughout the day, but my face didn't look shiny at all if I applied this foundation just once in the morning (and made sure not to touch my face, rubbing the foundation off); it stayed matte all day.

I have to think this isn't a good foundation if you're pretty oily all-over, because while the foundation feels very light, it's very thick and may feel uncomfortable. Aside from my t-zone, my skin is pretty normal (sometimes even dry in summer from overusing the A/C) and the foundation felt fine to me. I can see this would probably be a pretty good choice for normal, dry, and/or sensitive skin.

Lastly, here's a list of benefits from the little information slip that was in the box:
- preservative-free
- fragrance-free
- nickel-controlled (absolute minimum nickel content)
- hypoallergenic
- non-comodogenic
- SPF 20
- sweat control"

397770,3,"Well first of all I will address the ""gift set"" label. The products come in a pretty if rather unspectacular tin, which is fine, but they are all just wrapped in tissue paper and floating around in there, and the tin is large compared to the small size of these products! It's not very gift worthy, and certainly not impressive when you open it. Second of all, the products themselves, after two weeks of use have really no noticeable effect on wrinkles, pore size, or overall health of skin compared to my other facial moisturizer (oil of olay). So if given the option to buy this for a gift I would pass."

At first I thought this mini version was gonna be as small as the play but I was wrong! It has a very nice size so I don't think you need the big version at all."

399086,5,"The salon where I get my curly hair cut uses Davines products and while I have always loved how my hair smells and is styled there, I never wanted to shell out for a higher-end product at home. I went through several drugstore gels: Garnier curl sculpting cream weighed my hair down, Curls botanical gel didn't have nearly enough hold, etc.  I finally bought the Davines cream gel (sold for less than retail on Amazon, at least) and oh my goodness, what a difference.
- I don't have to use nearly as much as I did with other gels--I scrunch mousse and gel into my hair when still sopping wet, so I use more gel at a time than some (since it gets diluted and some drips out during scrunching), but I only need about a quarter-size dollop of Davines for my thick, shoulder-length curls.
- It holds super well. It really helps my curls keep their shape and not get fuzzy, as my hair is prone to do.
- For those saying it's too sticky and crunchy: It really helps to have your hair very wet when you apply it, because I could see how the stickiness might be difficult to work with otherwise. As for crunchiness, once it's dry, I just scrunch it again and this helps to take away the stiffness, but magically the style still holds.
- It also helps my hair dry much faster (air dry or diffuser)!

Since I only wash my hair every 2-3 days, one bottle actually lasts me quite a long time, so it's completely worth it. In between washes, I use Davines This Is a Sea Salt Spray to refresh and rescrunch. (You could probably use any salt spray or maybe leave-in conditioner, possibly even water--but the Davines spray smells AMAZING.)"

The container is about the size of a quarter so you can slip it in your pocket."

217119,5,"So that I never have to worry about it selling out or the price going up! But this foundation for me is just wonderful.

I've tried many because as an unfortunate side effect of adulthood, I have suddenly been plagued with hormonal acne and I needed coverage for my very sensitive skin. And I mean sensitive. I had tried everything to get my skin to heal: Peter Roth, Kiehl's, Dermalogica and none of them worked for me, heck the first two made things WORSE. I've tried some others but I can't recall them because they were terrible. Anyway, I finally switched to a natural/organic/holistic regimen and it just did WONDERS for my skin. In fact, for all you sensitive skin oily/acne girls, you might be shocked to read that I use OIL as my moisturizer now.

Anyway, with a bit of primer, this foundation glides on great and will last all day (don't try to wear this without primer, IMO, it looks the best WITH). The coverage is wonderful, but thin it out and build!! It doesn't irritate my sensitive skin which is a godsend. In my opinion, it is best applied with one of those Beauty Blenders; It really softens the finish.

A little, goes a veryveryvery long way, so don't get too heavy handed early on or it will go cakey! My favorite primers for underneath this would be a toss up between Stila HD 10 in 1 Beauty Balm or Hourglass Mineral Veil Primer.

Now the part you care about, my SKINTONE:
I go it in Medium and will probably need Light/Medium in winter. I know matching online can be a pain in the rear...so I will say that I lean yellow. I would say....my face is NC20/25 ish but the rest of my body is a lot darker (SPF for days on my face! but a Cali girl loves her glow everywhere else) so I try to match my face to the rest of my tan-ness! If you're darker than NC25, you could probably still get away with using MEDIUM since again, I went MEDIUM so that everything matches since I am predominantly in shorts/tanks all summer long.

If I put the foundation on too thickly, it's a bit too dark, so I make sure to sheer it out. I don't need to add much bronzer because this already takes care of adding the tint to my skin. Truly, a little goes a very long way and you will have this jar forever!

I like to lightly set this with Lorac's Porefection (in PF3 for the center of my face and PF4 for the outer if you're curious) because it is amazing and also contains salycillic acid, though I am looking forward to getting TheBalm's setting powder and seeing how they pair together!

And that's everything I can think to tell you. I feel like I've revealed all my secrets for my fabulous face...LOL but hey! Sharing is caring, and hopefully, if you struggle from what I do, this review helps. Seriously, about the acne thing, I'd look into some organic options because for me, nothing else worked and I already was eating clean and leading a healthy lifestyle  so my ""inside"" was already as good as I can reasonably get it!"
1169,5,"This toothpaste whitened my teeth several shades after I used it for a few months.  The ingredients seem to be very strong, so I try to mix up with other toothpastes.  It is also a good acne remedy if you mix it with a little neosporin : )"

Any depth comes from hints of cedar wood, vetivert, and water-like scent in the fading.  It's attitude is happy and robust.

My lower extremeties appeared to be covered in hives and were intensely itchy within 12hrs of treatment. My under arms and bikini line did not develop this reaction (thankfully), but the lower legs certainly did and required treatment with oral steroids.  I have found no reviews this far from anyone with similar reactions, however did find a research article from overseas that documented multiple cases of similar.  I then attempted a patch test with a lower intensity, yet still had the reaction.  As for the other areas I've treated, I have seen great results and plan to continue use."

The only bad thing I can say about this whip is that it seems to be a bit heavy for my kind of hair. I think someone with hair that isn't quite as fine would really appreciate using this.

I found this can be slight irritating immediately after application but didn't last at all; I liked the product.
One thing caution:  Do NOT drop this thing, because you will not be able to remove the stain.  I tried
everything, alcohol, makeup remover oil, spray-n-wash, yet it will come off the face?  Not your bathroom carpet!
Also suggest  you use disposable mascara brushes, they come by the 100, use and toss.  How I wish I had

67287,1,"I purchased Lanza Healing Color Care Shampoo from my salon, the first time, and paid $25.00 for it. I was shocked to pay that much for shampoo. However, I really liked the product and just a small portion did a great job of lathering. I also liked the way it made my hair so manageable. However, it was painful to pay that much for shampoo. I ordered my second bottle from an Amazon vendor. The bottle is the same but the formula is vastly different and nothing close to the original bottle from the salon. It smells the same but acts as though it is diluted. It takes twice as much product to get it to lather. My $8.00 savings turned out to be much less of a bargain than I imagined."
552381,5,"Awesome!"
480458,4,"This foundation is darker than most Natural colors available and is also yellower than most Natural colors. I typically use MAC Studio Fix Liquid or Powder in NC35 (powder) or NC37 (liquid) in winter, and C40 (powder) in Summer when my skin is more olive and tanned. This foundation does not really match although I would say it's closer to C40 or even C42 than any other shade. It's got a darker yellow cast to it than any other foundation in Natural shade. See pics with and without flash comparing it to MAC NC35.

I typically check for shades on findation dot com, a gem of a site that tells you the closest match in different brands based on the foundation shades you already use. However, they did not have any details for Bliss Empowder since it's a newer product.

It includes some natural ingredients like algae, cactus flower extract, chamomile that soften the skin. The finish is creamier and smoother than MAC and it provides dense coverage for a powder foundation and does not sit in fine lines. See pic of my fingers with product  over the respective shades Bliss Natural and MAC NC35.

 The case is nicely made and the mirror is very helpful. I prefer to  moisturize my face and then apply foundation with a stippling brush for light but overall smooth coverage. Since the shade was just a test sample, I will not rate it based on that.

It would remain to be seen if this gives me any breakouts like MAC can if I don't wash it off my face every night. If it works well I may try a shade that works better for me."

One thing: The Sabon Shower Oil even leaked a little and got on some of the other samples. Nothing a little water to rinse couldn't fix. Everything is sealed or on coated cardboard anyway, so it was easy to clean up. I'm still giving this five stars! Make this a subscription please!"

I'm glad that I went with that decision, because this baby is fantastic.  The first time I used it, the curl lasted from 5:30am, til I washed my face that night at 9.  I was floored by how well the curl lasted.  I've never had one not just hold that long, but hold and look exactly the way it did when I first curled my lashes and applied mascara.

The fit is also maybe slightly flatter than the Shu Emura, and it's an even closer contact.  For my eye shape this is great, though for some it could be too flat for those with rounder eyes.  At any rate, I'm very pleased with the curler and highly recommend it for anyone with almond-shaped eyes."

I only use the mint one because it's nice and fresh. I've smelled the others at a Sephora store and while they were nice, I tend to get sick of sweet scents. This lip balm is everything you would want from a lip balm - it is incredibly moisturizing and has SPF. All of the other lip balms I've tried with SPF have been thinner in consistency and did not really keep my lips moisturized for long. I find that I only need to apply this lip balm about 2-3 times a day. I'm only giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because I think it's a tad pricey for a lip balm, but it's definitely worth it."

It does exactly what it is supposed it. If I get any acne, at all, it's gone (COMPLETELY GONE) in two days. The redness subsides over night and it does not make my overly sensitive and insanely dry skin, flakey.

I have fine, dry hair and tend to run my fingers through my hair a lot.  My habits paired with this product is not a good combination.  But, I think that the product is better than the others I have tried.  As for me, I like how the Herbal Essences Set Me Up Spray Hair Gel gives me style control - even with super soft fine hair.

169002,5,"If you have sensitive skin, this is the cuticle remover for you. It's very gentle, and won't sting or irritate even if you leave it on for too long before washing it off. However: If you have very overgrown cuticles, you'll need several applications of this to reign them in, but you get plenty of product and you can use this every day/every other day, so it's not a big deal.
Overall, this is a very nice cuticle remover, and you could do a lot worse."
509252,4,"I have used this product only briefly, but my skin care person used it on my last facial and I did like the results.  I have rosacea and need to be careful about the products I use."
161041,3,"smells really good.."
38697,3,"Its ok!"
344453,5,"Great product! Fast shipment!  I recommend this product"
460576,1,"Did not like it at all. Tot as l waste of money!!!!"
111505,3,"The towels are much smaller than the towels I ordered the last time and for the same price."
333189,5,"Good soap.  Nice.  Would buy this again."
59169,4,"I'm still not sure if you're supposed to spray on before or after straightening, but doing it before and after seems to work.  I saw some people didn't like the smell, but I found the smell to not be bad at all, just smells like a hair product like you would smell in the salon.  It does make hair shinier. I hold a few inches away from my head and spray real quick cause if you spray too much too close it does seem like it could make hair look greasy. I like it works great!"
131618,1,"don't waste your money. It looks horrible."
568001,5,"This is a very rich non greasy nighttime lotion. It has no scent, that I can tell, which I really like. I use it at night and in the morning my skin still feels soft and moisturized. I really like it, I have acne prone but also dry skin. It is hard to find something moisturizing that does not cause break outs. So far this has been working well for me. I also like the way it dispenses, seems cleaner than sticking your finger into a jar. You push down on the top and the lotion comes up in the middle. See pics"
217610,5,"If I lost my home and my job and had to sleep under a bridge to keep dry, I would still collect pocket change until I could afford a can of this foam.  At least my feet wouldn't hurt.

Seriously, I've tried dozens of creams, lotions, etc etc for cracked heels, and nothing works like this stuff.  It's not cheap, but each can lasts a long time and believe me, it is well worth the investment."
491142,5,"I got this for my mom because she loves soy milk products. Both my mom and I love it even though we have different tastes. The quality is excellent and I love the smell."
81713,5,"This lip balm was a real find! I have tried so many lip balms and sun protection for my lips and none have come close to this tasty treat. It's high sun protection factor, 25 SPF, is so effective that I didn't suffer from the dry, chapped, and sunburned lips I get when I spend the entire day on the ocean. I only reapplied it once just because it was a new product for me and I wasn't sure if I needed to. The taste and smell is great too. This will definitely be a staple in my beach bag and another for my purse."
86139,4,"This is a really bright shade of red. I could not tell that from the picture, but I still like it."
214745,5,"Love the product"
559660,5,"Love this neutral color.. I was hesitant at first but I am very happy with the color and the smoothness of this brand.. I wear this almost every day. "
423350,4,"Love it."
567669,3,"not impressed with the smell of all three products"
24813,5,"Excellent"
29378,1,"I bought a dollar store one and it was a lot better than Zoya
will never buy another polish that would cost me that!
Disliked it !"
91554,5,"I can't stand the feeling of gel in my hair since it clumps hair, leaves white residue, and just doesn't do the job but 1 out of every 8 times you use it. W8less extra strong spray is essentially the perfect gel in spray form, without all the sticky and disgusting mess. Easy to apply, dries quickly, and you can put headphones/a hat on without thinking thinking twice about the spray destroying either. I play hockey on a regular basis and the fact this stuff won't drip down into my eyes and burn them like acid is also an enjoyable feature (all other gels/hairsprays have done this). Simply put, my go-to if my hair needs to stay in any certain position of my choosing."
48227,5,"I love this color.  Cherry Bomb is my all time favorite, but this one is coming in 1st. real fast .  Great summer color !!  Goes with everything!  You will look it !!  You will have to order it from Amazon I hadn't found it anywhere else !!!!!!"
422026,5,"I love the Curl Freak! It takes no time at all and it gently pulls the hair in. The settings gs are a plus since I have layered processed hair."
210118,5,"I have very sensitive skin.  Over the years I have tried many different things to help.  This is the second order of Proraso Shaving Soap I have made and I do not anticipate changing.  The product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent.  This was good for me as I also don't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells.  This shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint.  The most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously.  I use this shaving soap and switched to a DE razor.  Although my skin hasn't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else I have tried through the years.  I am very happy with this purchase."
238524,5,"I use this at night because of my dry skin.  I like to spray dry, itchy areas like my neck and face before going to bed.  I haven't woken up scratching ever since.  Now I keep a steady supply in my nightstand."
388870,5,"Works well"
434891,1,"This product is diluted with water! Very disappointed!!"
382507,4,"I like it very much. Just wanted the scent to last longer."
131930,4,"Toppik fills my edges in great, can't even tell the cover up"
282316,1,"this is not professional grade like it says, I waited for an hour and it still did not dry. Do not waste your money.."
51610,5,"Thanks"
48243,1,"I started using this products after looking up the internet for a good set of men's face products. I used it for a month initially without much problems apart from the occasional stinging sensation after applying the lotion. It contains alpha hydroxy acids which make make skin sensitive to sun exposure.

Then recently i developed severe dermatitis/ eczema on my face. I have always had a good and clear complexion but now its all red and angry looking and my face is rough like sandpaper. I attribute this to the skin products as i have never had problems with my skin before."
261054,5,"excellent product I really like, I'm satisfied. It is a good product I recommend 100%. It is high quality yet stablish"
523239,5,"very good"
274823,5,"just what I expected from Hot Tools"
305623,4,"good product and it takes dirt off and it softens the skin."
164260,5,"Great product."
129839,5,"Forget cheap drug store chap stick. This stuff is the best lip product I've ever used!"
44172,1,"The flat iron won't work it turns on but won't heat up"
408486,5,"Smells great (clean smell) soaks right in and definitely conditions your hands.  Living in AZ I use sunblock daily and this really lives up to its promise.  Our hands take a beating and this really smooths then out along with the added protection.  Highly recommend to all."
55283,5,"Great item this drives my wife crazy when I wear it! : )"
10974,5,"Been usung this product for a year and works great."
68082,5,"This is the first eyeliner I have found that will actually stay on my eyelid all day and not wear off. It's thick and looks good. I don't see myself ever buying another brand of eyeliner."
431532,5,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR A FEW YRS. MY SON NEEDED SOMETHING TO WASH FACE WITH THAT DIDNT STRIP AND DRYOUT, FIRST THING HE SAID WAS MAN THAT STUFF SMELLS GOOD, ITS NOT PERFUMY JUST CLEAN FRESH SCENT WITH A HINT OF FRUIT."
529786,2,"When I saw Moroccan Myrrh I was expecting some deep, rich exotic spice. And, the packaging, with the little turn key? Man, I was hooked. But, it appears to be all marketing. What it actually has is a strong citrus smell reminiscent of something Axe or Old Spice might be offering. I'm sure there is some 14 year-old out there that can't wait until he's old enough to start shaving that would think this scent is the height of sophistication, but if your tastes are a little more refined please don't bother. OK, maybe that's a little unfair. But, it's definitely not more sophisticated than anything you could find at a typical drugstore."
257290,5,"Great for longer hair and really makes shiny"
458666,1,"waste of money"
34394,5,"I wish that I had started using Proraso shaving Cream years ago. Combined with my Merkur 180 razor wet shaving for has never been better. The Proraso has a great scent and cool soothing feel to my face with outstanding protection. awesome!"
71497,5,"great quality"
190491,5,"My second one.  After my motor blew out (you'll get about 5 years out of it) I replaced with same model. Wouldn't buy anything else."
393656,3,"I was happy with the coverage of this makeup and it didn't break me out. I have sensitive skin. But the shade is too dark for my skin tone. They don't offer a shade lighter. So that was disappointing. I usually wear an ivory shade."
143575,1,"Doesn't work for me unfortunately. Makes my face very oily."
249738,5,"you wouldn't believe your hair could be better after flat ironing or curling but it is with  the iron guard spray.  The heat locks in the protective ingredients to turn my curly hair into straight silky tresses."
20045,5,"This product it's fantastic. You should be careful when using it specially if your skin is sensitive.
I'm very very happy with the results. After using for just one month my face now it's clear of acne scars and the brown spots are 99% gone. My skin never looked this healthy before.
  I will continue to use it as part of my daily beauty routine.
Love it, love it, love IT!"
160251,5,"My neck seems firmer after using this cream for a few weeks. It doesn't smell weird like some firming creams. It blends well."
53174,5,"Smells great and a wonderful price"
256729,5,"Awesome neutral colors and looks good on my olive skin AND my daughter's ivory skin. Easy to apply. Doesn't clump and spreads evenly. I will be buying more of this brand.  The colors are truly beautiful!"
235576,5,"I can't live without both of these products now! I have been using them for about a year now. I don't have KP, but I read online that it would get rid of those crusty age spots that I HATE. I started dry brushing every day before I shower, then use the body wash with the puff. In the shower. After the shower I mix a little of the lotion with coconut oil in my hand and rub that all over. I mix it because the lotion by itself makes my skin a little itchy and stingy. I didn't notice an immediate result in the crusty spots but gradually over this year they have almost all disappeared. Plus I used to have really grainy bumpy skin on my knees which is totally gone and my elbows look great. Overall I think my skin looks really young for my age. This is worth the money, just stay with it and use it most everyday because like anything it takes a little time to work."
76941,5,"I purchased these to fit a razor I bought for my husband from The Art Of Shaving. At the store the blades were $12.  They are the exact same thing except they didn't come in the plastic packaging for just $5. Will always buy them here."
280187,5,"I love this perfume"
317240,5,"Long wearing and easy to apply formula.  Love the Essie line.  Was not able to find in the local store.  Fast shipping and brand new bottle"
288578,5,"Love Ahava products! This soup smells divine and I can't wait to buy more!"
44965,5,"I have a lot of thick, coarse hair and this straightener works great. It heats up fast and has plenty of heat settings. This thing gets really hot! It comes with a glove because your hair can get really hot when you use it. I personally don't use the glove because its kind of a hassle. If you don't want to shell out the money for a Chi straightener, in my opinion, this is the next best. I'm glad I spent a little more money than I would have for one from the drugstore."
553040,5,"C&C strength was recommended to me by my dermatologist after a decade of struggling with terrible acne that leaves my skin full of spots. This stuff seems to miraculously deal well with both the acne and the dark spots. My face is very smooth and bright now. Will be buying again"
549801,5,"Its an amazing scent. I love it and get plenty of compliments at work."
564953,5,"I love the smell and it absorbs into the skin leaving you nice and soft. A couple of my male co workers told me I smelled like flowers at a funeral home. Not cool, but I like the smell"
406961,5,"Exactly what I expected!  Thanks."
455713,5,"Love how it highlights."
531803,5,"I love this stuff.. this one was a gift tho and it leaked but once again Amazon stepped up to the plate and took care of the problem."
186811,4,"This is a nice bronzer but it is definitely on the darker side. My complexion is pretty fair and had yellow undertones and I think this bronzer looks too dark on me."
501846,5,"Found this at a spa in Hawaii and we love it. Glad to see it is for sale here. Will buy again, it has a nice clean citrus smell that is not flowery or overpowering."
156930,5,"yes"
216361,2,"Not worth the money at all.  I like my Murad products much better."
387242,4,"This product definitely worked for me, my lashes are much longer now, however, there is a little bit of irritation in that my eyelids look a little bit pink."
47320,5,"It was wonderful.  My stylist recommended this particular brand of hair dryer.  She was right, it makes drying my hair quicker and allows me to style the way I want.  I can achieve a natural, straight look....it is a great product and it was at a great affordable price!"
299808,1,"As everyone else says, your hair feels like it has hairspray in it. I'm not a fan at all. I'm going back to Chi. Was just trying to find an aerosol spray."
249181,5,"Bought this and the liquid product together at half the cost it is being sold for at my salon. If you've never tried this oil for your hair you're in for a treat. Leaves hair SUPER shiny and soft. I have naturally curly hair--without product, it is actually nappy. When I want to not blow dry it straight bug want a polished, sleek ponytail or bun, I put it on damp hair to achieve that look. When I blow dry my hair, I use the spray before and after to get a sleek silky finish. You don't need a lot and it makes a world of difference. I also bought the organic, 100% pure product sold on Amazon...can't wait to use it also. This is a real deal on the price too..."
524593,1,"I DON'T LIKE IT AT ALL. IT DON'T DO ANYTHING. WHEN I PUT IT ON IT BURNS MY SKIN. AFTER IT DRIES -  I TOUCHED MY FACE AND IT HAS CLUMPS THAT OF THE PRODUCT COMING OFF. I WILL NOT BE BUYING THIS AGAIN."
337984,2,"Did not work for me as advertised."
475982,5,"Great foundation! As a 61 year old woman, this foundation gave me nice coverage with a dewy glow. Does not feel heavy or caked over my skin. I also like the application wand, as I can control exactly how much foundation I apply to my face. It also evens out the redness on my cheeks, without having to apply a primer. I get compliments all the time on how great my skin looks, people usually think I'm in my 40's. Now you all know my secret!"
47589,3,"Very expensive for the size"
258577,5,"Fast shipping great price"
168992,5,"I purchased this for my wife. It is always sold out of the stores. She was very happy. She loves this stuff."
464602,5,"Been using this for years.  Keep trying different brands and keep coming back.  Leaves your hair squeaky clean and great smell."
361235,5,"This blush is so pigmented, applies true to pan, and is easy to blend. It stays put all day too. Absolutely no complaints."
393764,3,"It covers well enough. I was looking for something to hide some sun damage spots. It did cover them fairly well when layered a couple of times. However, it has a sticky and shiny finish that never dries and makes a muddy mess when applying powder over it."
41708,5,"I smell wonderful!! The people around comment on how good I smell."
153983,1,"I love most of Jack Black's products but I feel like this one is a miss for me.  They call it a lather but it hardly lathers at all.  For the price, I want superior protection which I feel it did not provide so it looks like I'm going back to gels."
139681,5,"Feels great. Acne spots began healing by the next day. Love Mario Badescu products"
512118,4,"Great product, but check the expiration day."
251166,1,"I haven't had very much luck with Japonesque brushes and tools in the past and I decided to give this arty since I have long corner eyelashes. We'll this didn't work either. It fails to grab and hold with enough power to curl."
88037,5,"pretty"
39464,3,"Cover up her stanky ass farts. I'm not a fan of perfumes or sprays but this does help in covering up a potion of her poos n farts."
540962,5,"Wonderful shampoo!"
490639,5,"LOVE!"
262904,5,"I seriously love this stuff, nothing works better on my curls to keep them hydrated, nonfrizzy, and tamed without the crunchy or greasy effect."
12221,5,"This is by far the best foundation ever. I have been using this foundation for years and I love the way it goes on so smooth, my skin looks so PERFECT!!!  I have very oily skin but no matter wet or dry this foundation works great.  The only thing is I can only find this foundation on Amazon now.  I use to buy it at Sephora but they don't have it anymore.  Sad ;)  But ovrall the BEST ever!!!"
328659,5,"I use this daily and it helps give my thin hair a little boost."
508943,5,"Hands down the best cologne anywhere. I've been wearing this for years, and people always want to know the secret to my scent. Notes of smoke and citrus, it's an outdoorsy and masculine yet refined smell. Some people think it smells like a far-away campfire, others like something more fruity. It has none of those hints of chemical scent that too many colognes are afflicted with."
417915,5,"Great product and an amazing price"
310064,5,"I don't wear makeup that often, but I do really enjoy this product."
81548,5,"I love this lip balm."
482810,3,"I think the product changed.  It comes out more of an orange color than a bronze color like before.  Not happy!  This used to be my favorite tanning lotion..  Ugh!"
508157,5,"Love this simple yet elegant soapdish.  Looked for it in the L'Occitane brick and mortar store and they did not carry it.  Luckily I found it on Amazon.  It looks great in my French inspired kitchen.  Highly recommend this item."
441614,4,"Love that it's a heated brush - easier to use and more versatile than the In-styler and straightening irons.  Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the shape is not quite round, so creating a smooth bend at the ends takes some practice.  Overall I recommend."
185145,5,"The chi reconstructing conditioner leaves my hair soft.  Combined with the chi infra shampoo, my hair is moisturized eliminating the dryness from my hair.  The conditioner smells great as well.  My hair is not only soft but detangled."
429654,5,"I had one already bought this one for my daughter in law"
63575,5,"I had a version from the 90's or later in this brand and it looks exactly the same as far as design, mine was in green and it was my mothers. this curling iron heats up very quickly and the smallest size is the width of my pinky finger and my ring size is 3 lol. the stand does not get hot. the case is very nice im going to keep it. very durable cord. this is going to last you at least 30 years."
245016,5,"I have been using this product for 3 years. I love it. It helps with dark circles and puffiness. It is worth a try."
435735,5,"I love this shampoo. Gets your hair clean, with an extra tingle of mint."
213172,5,"After asking my stylist about this product and he highly recommended it, I was excited to purchase this. Rusk is a great brand and the product is reliable and easy to use. I have long thick hair and this was easy to use and it didn't catch or pull my hair like many irons do. It is also easy to use to make big curls. Rusk is a brand that is living up to its legacy of good products."
108981,3,"I have sensitive skin and this burned after application for at least 5-10 minutes.  This is my least favorite PCA product."
178989,5,"The wife is very happy. This has a very soft flexible cord and the cord swivels 360 continually. Temp goes to over 400 and is variable from about 200 and up."
180229,5,"Best iron ever."
355760,5,"This mousse foundation is just lovely. It's SO easy to apply and doesn't soak into the beauty blender, which means MUCH less waste! I love that! And once on you can't even feel it, it's so silky soft! I don't reapply because I'm not really that picky, but some of my freckles and sun spots show through after a few hours of wear. The color is also a bit lighter than I hoped it would be, but overall it's a lovely foundation that I'd be glad to purchase in the future."
423145,5,"Real good shaving gel. Dose the job for doing line ups"
218235,5,"It heats up good and its a great size for traveling, therefore I am satisfied with this purchase."
177662,5,"I already had the Hot Tools Professional 1181 curling iron.  I really liked it.  It burned out, so I wanted to replace it with the same one.  It is a great product.  I also received it in a very short time.  Wouldn't use any other curling iron ever."
254036,1,"Very sticky. Makes my eyelid stick open. And creates a second line on my top lid."
110645,5,"This is a great tanner very easy to apply and no streaking."
289974,1,"The product is good.  But dissatisfied Products cover has not yet begun. Has been damaged."
219019,5,"Great tool! Able to grip every piece."
306013,5,"Great shampoo and conditioner. Awaken is a great Surface product if you need a therapeutic shampoo for scalp issues."
417558,5,"This along with the rinse is my go to ~  I can go almost six weeks between salon visits!  That's saying a LOT!"
479259,3,"Having my doubts that this product is legit."
314134,4,"The flavor/scent could be described more as mixed berry, and only lightly scented. Although it is very lightweight, it does a decent job of hydrating. Goes on easily. Very good considering the low price."
315072,5,"nice"
550352,3,"Rating this as just 'ok'. I find it neither fabulous nor poor but nothing stands out about it. The formula was clumpy on day 1 upon opening (ie: little clumps on wand always when you pull it out). The brush has a nice shape. curved and the underside has shorter bristles so that you don't end up with globs at the eyelash root as you brush to the ends of the upper lashes.

Not worth the price IMO"
511688,4,"Great face mask. I have roseaca and definitely saw less redness within the first use. Only issue, the seal was slightly broken when I recieved. Otherwise I would have given 5 stars"
415421,5,"Leaves my hair soft and doesn't take a lot to work it through to the ends."
231546,5,"Pair this with the Mustela lotion & we have been eczema free so far this winter."
514788,4,"Great brush except for shedding...It blends blush like a dream. It has just the right size and picks the right amount of product for applying blush on the cheeks!"
193277,1,"Zirh Shaving Cream

P&G purchased Zirh in 2009 and made many product changes. Consumers didn't like the changes and stopped buying the products and retailers dropped the Zirh line. P&G dropped the Zirh line, which is currently being sold by TPR Holdings.

The new P&G formula that was released in 2009 is horrible, most retailers had stockpiles which lasted through early 2010, so many consumers didn't even realize that the product had changed until they got home. Once it did change, sales associates at both Macy's and Nordstrom's said that they were getting multiple returns for the shave cream product.

Macy's and Nordstrom's dropped the Zirh line...

The primary ingredient in the old shave cream was Aloe Vera, the new crappy products main ingredient is water. Which seems fraudulent to advertise the product as an ""extremely concentrated formula"" because the primary ingredient is water. Also, stating that ""one jar should last up to 3 to 4 months"" is making a false statement as the new product would not last any longer than 8 weeks with regular use. However, the prior formula would last 3 to 4 months for one person (I've used the old product since 2002 and purchased a large stockpile that ran out in June of 2012).

I don't know why they would continue selling the product with the new formula.

32334,5,"Wonderful detangler for my luscious locks!"
62585,4,"Never pay full price for an AOS product.  But, if you are looking for a good wet shave cream, this is an excellent product.  It is particularly goof for making lather directly on your face with a good brush.  Take a small amount on your fingers, rub it on your face in a very, very thin coat.  Don't worry it if doesn't cover everywhere.  Then take a good, wet brush and make the lather right on your face.  This product is great for a safety razor or a cartridge razor.  Not as good if you are using a straight razor but if you are using a straight razor, you already know what you like.  Aroma is excellent."
92778,1,"I didn't like anything about this lotion.  The lotion didn't absorb well, didn't smell terrible but wasn't great and it's over-priced."
235240,5,"I love the lotion of Glytone because you get a lot of product with 17.5 acid for your money. Great deal!"

224323,5,"Nice"
536181,5,"I used to have curly hair and over time it just kind of turned between wavy and straight but this product brought back the curls I missed so much, my hair didn't even have form, I curled my hair with heating iron to give it form but I no longer do that because this leaves my hair feeling and smelling great."
39309,5,"I am very pleased with this purchase thank you very much !!!"
270589,3,"Smells nice, but it didn't really do very much to thicken my hair.  I continue to use it for the refreshing smell."

269258,1,"Have been ordering this product for two years with no problems, I received it yesterday and it is completely different consistency and color and when I put it on it burned my skin. I would not recommend buying from the seller."
208026,1,"Been using Derma Topix Benzoyl Peroxide 10 wash since I was 16 (I'm now 36!). To my dismay, I come on Amazon to replenish my stash and...it's gone! And replaced by THIS???? And more expensive, too! WTF???? I went on Dermstore's website to see if they'd have it, and its all gone over there too! Seriously, I am so pissed off right now. I guess I need to buy a new product becasue I will NOT be taking my changes with this random replacement. This is a prime example of how corporations shoot themselves in the foot by their own greed. BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL!!! (At The ORIGINAL PRICE!!!!)"
83789,5,"Smells like sugar! Doesn't get stale at end of day. I have a sensitive scalp and sulfur smelling hair when I use certain products, maybe the sulfate  or parabens.. But this spray doesn't bother me at all!"

332447,5,"EXCELLENT!!!"
346589,5,"I first tried Marula oil at a spa in Chicago.  I then started ordering it online.  Just a few drops and my skin feels like silk.  I have combination skin and still this is fine to use.  I have used Sunday Riley Juno and yet I still like this one better.  **There are times during the summer where i will only use it nightly due to the humidity during the day.  This does not make my skin break out at all."
153705,5,"Amazing hair product! Gives you amazing waves and loose curls without even doing anything to your hair. I use the product especially for when I need to do my hair fast and don't want to use heat products. It gives my hair a nice beach-wave look, almost like I used a curling iron. Will definitely keep purchasing and using this product, great buy!"
540123,1,"knockoff!!!!!!!

Love the real product!"
316579,2,"I am kinda bummed to be honest. I was really excited and looking forward to trying The balm nude'Tude palette. It got several good reviews however mine is not going to be a good review due to the following... i did not get the same palette displayed. The naughty version with the ladies on it, is the one displayed in the picture. i got the version with the inside of the room. if you arn't going to send me the one displayed in the pictures then don't display it! i have the Naked 2 palette by Urban Decay which i prefer over this one. It isn't the colors on this palette that i don't like it is the shadow itself. The balm product doesn't blend as nice as the UD and i have to put more layers of the lighter Balm shadows onto my lid for it to show up. i am fair skined so this is surprising. Also in the Silly shade there is way to much glitter. you can see chunks of glitter in it which some of you may like. Shipping was prompt so that was nice. And i just realized instead of the schitzo color as displayed i got a seductive in place of it. The brush that comes with it isn't very good so if you plan to buy this make sure to buy a different brush."
308085,5,"The Jan Marini producs are the first products i have used that actually show a visible change to the surface of my skin within 2 weeks. Truly amazing. Healthy is the most often word I here about my appearance"
493434,5,"Great for my loose powder! Provides an even application. High quality brush. Soft on the skin. I would highly recommend it!"
385408,5,"I love the way gloMinerals Luxe Liquid makeup feels and looks on my skin. I have tried several foundations that were either too harsh or too oily. I have finally found my makeup that looks good."
96614,5,"I've tried many, many facial cleansers over the years and this is the best by far.  I have oily skin."
244986,1,"I just received an empty bottle, hence the 1 star.  It was wrapped just as usual, no sign that the package had been opened, so I presume it was an error from the factory. This is the first time this has happened, I use this eye cream all the time."
482633,5,"Great product that doesn't weigh my hair down!! I wash my hair, towel dry a little bit. I use two pumps and start at the ends working my way up. I blow dry my hair and then I'm done. Leaves my hair feeling light and fluffy with no frizz."
538977,5,"Love this Pureology product. My hair feels amazing. Well worth the price!"
538156,4,"It reached what I need"
542631,3,"Loved it while it lasted but mine also quit heating up after approximately 1 1/2 years of daily home use."
115321,1,"it was complely damaged when I did open it"
333277,5,"They nailed it.  They have this product just perfect.  I am a huge fan of their product line."
21377,5,"I've tried several different products which are less expensive than Toppik, and none of them cover up the way Toppik does. I have had a balding scalp since a child, must be a genetic thing but nothing seems to work to keep those spots growing hair, so I had to find a new remedy, so happy to find this product and use on my bald spots. I now don't have to play for hours trying to cover it all up, just shake on some Toppik, fluff up my hair and ready to go!!!"
550138,5,"It is refreshing. No bad part"
149139,4,"Feel like it does something, but maybe that's just a mind trick because I don't see pimples disappearing any faster. I think the smell of the product (which is kind of irritating to the eyes in the best sort of im-super-cleaning kind of way) gives me the same feeling that harsh exfoliating gives me, where it kind of hurts but in a good way that makes me feel like progress is being made.

Does it work? who knows. Will I buy more when it runs out? probably."
206447,5,"Love this razor.  My only suggestion is that if you have sensitive skin and enjoy shaving everyday be careful with this guy because it's pretty aggressive.  It has a great heavy feel to it and a short handle which make it very easy to use.  You can get a VERY close shave with this razor and it's a pleasure to use."
168562,5,"Great for dry heels and calluses---took about 6 weeks of daily use but now they are smooth and soft!"
91751,5,"I am the type that I could not go even one day without my nail polish chipping or peeling completely off. I bought this after reading reviews. I bought it in combination with the Stickey Anchoring base coat by CND. I can't believe how well it keeps my polish on. I will get some chips if my nails are longer but I've since cut them about even with my finger tips and I can go a whole week without any chips. The edges of my nails will get worn off but it's not noticeable unless you get right up on it. I did swipe my nails with alcohol prior to putting on the polish. I add the base coat, before it's dry add the polish. It will still be wet. Before that's dry I apply the Super Shiney top coat. I've used both OPI and Sinful Colors nail polish and both have stayed. Totally digging this stuff."
263762,5,"Perfect liner - especially for inner rim. Very creamy. No tugging on the delicate eye area. Used MAC smolder for years but this Stila liner has definitely become my new favorite. You won't be disappointed."
415907,5,"Smells great!"
221251,5,"This professional hair dyer makes blowing out my thick, naturally curly hair so much quicker and easier. My hair blows out smooth and shiny with no frizz! Yay! I had read other product reviews before ordering this and many reviewers complained of the location of the toggle switches and the director attachment blowing off during use but I have not had any problems with either. The location of the toggle switches are fine for my grip and the flow director attachment fits fine and has not blown off during use; I use it for every blow-out. The price is great for this professional quality hair dryer."
84536,5,"This stuff is amazing. I used this after applying one of my thinner nail colors that takes more coats for full coverage. My nails were completely dry after about three minutes. I love the scent, it's light and I don't feel like I'm spraying chemicals all over my hands. As a side note, I noticed that it dried my matte top coat a lot faster than my glossy one."
265714,1,"Doesn't stay longer than 4-5 days ,bad quality."
246660,5,"This hair dryer does an amazing job. Most of the hair dryers that I've used do not put the type of power this one does. My hair is really thick so I need all the power I can get. So overall this one is great if your looking for power to handle that thick hair!!"
569796,5,"Pricey but good stuff"
302173,5,"This is the only brand of hair product I will use. I have very curly hair and this has made all the difference for it."
15582,5,"Does make you hair look and feel thicker; the fibers are good too but they do cause a little itch on the scalp; this works almost as good without having to dust the powder on.  A little expensive but I think worth it"
371625,5,"Love this oil. Amazing for your skin too."
448032,5,"I love this sunscreen.  It goes on easily and rubs in with no leftover residue.  I use it under my moisture.  Great product.  I will continue to purchase."
194718,5,"Good quality"
42407,5,"Great fragrance. Great soap"
112641,5,"I have been wearing Sponge-on Flawless Finish since I saw another woman in passing and asked her what she was wearing!  Really nice coverage that stays on and looks smooth.  Small compact that fits in any makeup bag.  This makeup is for anyone who loves the full coverage to make a perfect finish.  I wear it year-round too, as it's not too heaving in the Summer."
175592,5,"Believe the reviews! Perfect setting spray for your makeup or just a nice spritz on a fresh face."
419562,5,"Excellent buy"
383769,5,"I usually don't review beauty products since I am not that into makeup and skin care. I bought this product because I had an amazon gift card and was looking for a cleanser that actually work. Did some research and found this product and am very happy to say after 3 days of use I am noticing a huge difference. I am using a new moisturizer after cleansing, which could be contributing to the change in my skin. As a 28yo woman with acne I am glad to finally find a product that works. I don't wake up with new pimples everyday. I am sooooo happy to find this product."
563722,4,"I like the product but I believe it is very overpriced."
284196,5,"I am writing to let all the women out that there that have been looking for an answer to long lasting nail polish. I have been painting my nails for 25 years and ""always"" have to touch up using regular nail polish.  I heard from a dear friend, Michelle about this awesome new CND Shellac.  I order the uv light and a couple of colors. I have been using the CND Shellac for almost one month. I LOVE IT!!!  It does not damage your nail beds at all.  Application is easy and taking the shellac off is done very easily too.  I work full time,  do dishes and normal cleaning duties and haven't had any chips or dulling of the color.  I am completely amazed.  Definitely look into it if you are thinking of purchasing this unbelieveable invention.

277488,5,"This shampoo doesn't weigh your hair down. You don't need much to get a great lather. Gentle enough to use daily, but does not build up. Love it!"
352603,5,"Besides being absolutely delightfully witty, its a great palette. I have been looking for a good matte palette and this is the one! Its my daily user. I venture to say I like this more then Naked 1 and almostttt as much as Naked 3 and its considerably less money. The color stays all day, blends well, and looks great. Get it! I used Two Faced eye shadow primer which probably helps the durability of the product I'm assuming but either way it goes on good."
196610,4,"Been using this for weeks.  It comes out like a bubbly gel but it lathers up and cleans well.  It has a rather strong smell.  I feel it really removes the oil but leave my skin dryer than usual after using.  In regards to acne, my son started using it.  So far nothing dramatic has happened.  He doesn't have a lot pimples though, maybe about 5 across the forehead and face.  But he likes the feeling of cleanliness after washing his face."
100347,4,"Hi, this product is very good, I love the smell of fresh, my wife likes and my friends love it, is something youthful fragrance"
384091,4,"Best facial cream in the market!  Too bad it is so expensive!"
328495,1,"Definitely for people with thin hair. Mostly just weighed down my roots and gave them a greasy feel. Would not repurchase this."
485857,4,"I love the scentless feature of this product which works as expected. Easy to apply."
222403,5,"This came in two days, looked brand new, worked amazingly and even if it was second hand i wouldn't mind because of how low the price was! I was very worried that this was some sort of scam, because Babyliss curling iron like this one is usually 70 dollars, or $100+ if you buy in a beauty supply shop.
I used it today, and wow. My hair looks amazing and I didn't even use hairspray so that I could see how long they would hold--and they held all day! My hair didn;t slip off of the barrel like other reviewers said, and it definitely did not even come close to crimping my hair.. I think those reviewers might have been using the curling iron incorrectly. This product is great!! And for the price, it is too good to pass up. Im so glad I bought this!!"
307877,5,"Works well... love it."
117664,4,"Very good well satisfied"
135695,5,"Very nice. Not oily or greasy. Nice light scent."
366089,5,"REally work well and are good quality!"
111143,5,"Hands down my favorite tinted moisturizer. It's rich, creamy, applies quickly and evenly. It's not overly shiny, even with the SPF. I add a dusting of sexy mama translucent powder and I look put together and ready to go.
The light is perfect for my NC15 coloring, and blends out easily.
It is priced well and the tube lasts a really long time!"
497224,1,"Definitely not for the avg man. This smells like unisex. Sprayed once, and sadly threw it out"
567528,5,"Love it!"
100728,5,"This is absolutely the best dry shampoo I have ever used.  Ive only used about 3 or 4 but this one has them all beat by miles.  Usually I don't see much of a difference In my hair and Ive had at least one that smelled like smelling like alcohol, not this one, it actually lifts your hair up at the roots and makes it look clean and even feels clean.  I got it from a fabfitfun box so not bought it here yet...  but I will be as soon as I run out."
182483,2,"Definitely not as good as other people are saying. And most of it comes off when you're asleep in the bed. It flakes off very quickly and easily. Didnt help me much at all"

457752,5,"Game changer. Will never bleach my hair again without Olaplex. I've been using the product for about 6 months now, and I can see a line in my hair from when I started using it!"
387531,5,"I do not normally write reviews. The results of this product changed my mind. If you put this on daily it will work. Some say it takes a few weeks. I have found if you hang in there 3 or 4 months you will not be able to question the results. This stuff is amazing and will work for you. It does not change the color of anything. They only time I experienced and discomfort from this product it was my own fault. I was tired and got it in my eye or I put it on to heavily and its ran in my eye. Put it on lightly like eyeliner and you will have no trouble. This will work. I have recommended it to several friends and it has worked on everyone"
65227,4,"While this is not an anti-antiperspirant in the sense of ""sure"" with aluminum  it is the best non-antiperspirant stick that I have found. It has witch-hazel which is a slight wetness-stopper. But more importantly, I no longer have pimples under my arms caused by aluminum (I actually had to make a trip to a doctor about them). Deodorant is more than a smell cover-up, it is supposed to kill bacteria that cause the odors. I have found that appropriate grooming (clipping), regular showers, and use of this product is enough to keep me reasonable. For one day, it works as well as any antiperspirant ever did. Now about the price....well..it's almost criminal to charge that much, but I pay it."
279193,5,"I had been given a sample size of Not Like the Movies when it was first released, and had not tried it until a month ago... and it was love at first swipe! In the bottle the polish has an iridescent green and pink-ish look, but on the nail it has a really nice lavender/pink color! True to the OPI brand, it's a beautiful and durable polish... I do love it and I'm glad I didn't throw the sample away!"
85789,5,"Gorgeous white/cream color with just the right amount of iradescence. Looks gorgeous on tan and not so tan feet/hands. "

9461,5,"I am a long time user of Jane Iredale products; and the Amazing Base is my favorite--followed closely by the blush.  I wear the AB in Radiant, which is officially a neutral shade,  but is a very good match for my warm--but not excessively red or yellow--complexion. I love the way the Amazing Base goes on evenly and stays on all day. I find that my results with this product are best when I apply it to a freshly cleansed and moisturized face, using the Jane Iredale Handi brush or another kabuki-style brush and finishing with the JI flocked sponge (especially useful for the nose and under-eye areas.

I will be a JI customer for many years to come."

467790,5,"This is a basic deodorant with a premium scent.

Likes:
- Fragrance.  Smells great.
- Basic deodorant.  I don't use anti-perspirants, so this product works perfect for me.
- Odor control.  Seems to work as well as my current brand.

Dislikes:
- Cost.  Would be nice to have a trial size to try out before buying a full size stick.

Overall highly recommended if you want a basic deodorant with a premium fragrance."

90067,5,"I was a Gillette razor user for about 8 years now. After the recommendation from my brother, I decided to finally try a safety razor to save money versus the cartridge alternative. Initially, I was pretty nervous I would absolutely slice my face up if I was not extremely careful with the razor. Being a complete novice to the methodology of using a safety razor I was extremely cautious but by the time I got through a few strokes on my cheek I quickly realized they call it a ""safety razor"" for a reason. After my third time using it, I found I could be almost as careless as a Gillette. I'm never going back to 5 dollars a cartridge gimmicks again. I'm sure just about any safety razor could do the job if you're the same as any new convert from cartridges. Although you truly can feel quality with the Merkur. The whole piece feels like a nice solid weight without being a burden, and the razor doesn't protrude far from the guard, giving you a bit of breathing room on the whole ""slice your face off"" deal. Definitely worth a try, and this Merkur handle does emanate quality."
427665,5,"love it and it does the trick I have definitely noticed a lightening!"
309693,5,"It is always a tricky balancing act to get a hair putty that gives you that sheek shine without making your hair feel dirt and greasy (especially to other people who might be running their hands through it!).

This stuff definitely meets those qualifications. I have been using it for about 3 months now and have found that it works best if applied while hair is wet. One this I will say is that it doesn't have a ton of hold (at least for my hair). I have to pair it with a dollop of styling gel so that the hair stays the way I want, but this is to be expected."

207338,4,"Electrics don't shave me all that well and I got tired of spending so much money on Fusion blades AND getting razor burn on my neck. When I switched from canned shaving cream to Proraso and Art of Shaving pre-shave creams, oils and shaving creams, the quality and closeness of my shave with the same Fusion blades improved considerably. The more I researched the more I knew it would only be a matter of time before I tried a safety (DE) razor. Having read many reviews by rookies, I was fearful of cutting my face off and ordered the Merkur Futur. I don't blame the razor since I'm a rookie but my initial experience was that the razor settings ranged from won't hurt me but doesn't do much to call 911. However, no matter what the setting, I didn't get the overall close shave I was getting with Gillette Fusion.

Two weeks later I picked up the Merkur 15C and I will never go back to Gillette ever again. I'm now getting super close shaves and the razor cannot hurt me and never leaves razor burn, unlike Fusion. Also, unlike the Merkur Futur, the Merkur 15C has no problem shaving under my nose. The 15C is just so easy to use. Unlike the Futur, I don't see how I could use it in a way that the blade hits my face before the safety bar teeth. I'm finally confident enough with this razor to use it against the grain. I wouldn't mind a longer and heavier handle but being light and short, it does force you to learn control and agility. Now that I'm getting better at it, I'm also able to get a better shave from my Merkur Futur. If I had to pick one, I would definitely choose the 15C over the Futur because of closer shave, easier learning curve, much harder to hurt yourself and gets under your nose.

The best price for this is on WestCoastShaving dot com. It's the best razor for the price. It's also easy to clean. I'd suggest a $0.99 razor bank so your used blades don't slice through your trash bags. Persona blades (Israeli Red pack) on WestCoastShaving are much sharper than Merkur and Derby blades but no where near as decapitating as Feather. Lastly, do spend the money on quality pre-shave oil, shaving cream and a brush. If it's in a can, it's not quality. I have the $11 Tweezerman badger hair brush from Amazon. It doesn't feel anywhere near as nice as the $150 silver tip brushes at eShave or Art of Shaving but considering the $139 price difference, I don't care.

Bottom line, the Merkur 15C with the open comb/teeth and blade flush against the safety bar, is much safer than safety blades where there is a gap between the blade and the bar because it can't ""bite"" you. Not only that, but I find it shaves closer too. I can't imagine that anyone would go back to Gillette cartridges after trying this. Go spend $25 on the razor and $10 for 100 blades and enjoy the old school shave and the savings."

58187,5,"I have been using the blonde Jane Iredale Brow Gel for several years and love it, so when I recently dyed my hair a strawberry blonde, I wanted a more reddish tint to my eyebrows. When I first used it, I absolutely used too much and my brows looked too thick and heavy and too auburn. After several uses I finally figured out how to use it correctly, and that is with a VERY light hand! There is a lot of product on the wand when you pull it out, so now I make sure to gently rub some of it off on the inside top of the container. Then I blot a little more off on a paper towel. Finally I just barely brush it on eyebrows and it gives a beautiful result. My eyebrows are pretty thick already so just a little of this goes a long way. It keeps them in place all day, does not flake or melt off, feels flexible not stiff, and when used correctly it looks completely natural. I have never experienced an allergic reaction on skin or eyes, and I have VERY sensitive skin & eyes and am plagued by all sorts of allergies to things. There is no strange scent to the gel either, only a light, barely detectable smell if you put your nose right up on it. This brow gel is high quality and the blonde ones I've used lasted 6-8 months with daily use, so I expect the same from this auburn one. I recommend it highly."
297477,3,"It looks good and it works mechanically. I haven't seen any results yet, so I don't how to assess that yet! I think it's kind of expensive, but if I ever see results it'll be worth it!"

280767,5,"I love CND nail polish. It last 2 weeks if not longer. The colors choices are excellent."
192470,5,"This product is definitely another one of my top 100 products used in my household.  I've used Biolage products for many years.  My daughters and I discovered Matrix products when they were teens (they now have teens of their own) and they've been on our bathroom shelves since that time.  This product is great for me since I hate the residue left from some types of volumizing shampoos.  As I get older, I find I do need the hydrating shampoo which leaves my hair feeling silky smooth.  What can I say?  Given my choice of the great shampoos out there, I choose Biolage."
416773,5,"This product is very light in color opacity and consistency. It provides just enough to even out the skin tone and also provide 40 SPF. The Elta MD UV Daily Broad-Specturm SPF 40 is great! I love that it is multipurpose moisture, make-up, and skin sun protection and with a quality name that I trust for skin care. I do not get skin irritation from using this (no acne flare ups or sensitive itchy skin). I have olive skin tone and it blends in nicely.
Very happy with my purchase and I recommend it."

426541,5,"Great nude color. Not sticky and smells great!"
557811,5,"This Citadelle by Raw Spirit is a wonderful scent unlike anything else I have tried in the past.  My first impression was that it was a light, powdery scent that was not in any way fruity or flowery (which is a good thing).  Beyond the initial hint of baby powder, there is a rich earthiness that I really enjoy.  It's hard to put the scent into words, but truly powerful smells often trigger sense memories and that is exactly what I experienced here.  It instantly and powerfully took me back to an Alaskan cruise I took nearly a decade ago, specifically the cool, woodsy scent I recall from the deck as we navigated a narrow channel surrounded by trees and water.  It may seem strange to recall a specific memory like that, but that is what instantly came to mind when I tried this out.  What a wonderful scent to rekindle that very pleasant memory from my past.  If you enjoy smelling things like a forest in the afternoon, fresh rainfall, and cool mist, this would be a scent you would likely enjoy.

Citadelle comes double boxed, and the tall thin bottle is beautifully simple and fragile.  I will treasure this one-fluid-ounce bottle and use it on special occasions.  It is listed as unisex, and I suppose that is true.  The initial light powdery scent, however, may strike some as effeminate though the more powerful and lingering woodsy/smoky scent lingers and it does have some masculinity to it.  Overall, I am thrilled with this and would easily recommend for those willing to make a special purchase for quality and - hopefully - some pleasant scent memories."
449279,5,"Love this shampoo! A little pricey"
276267,1,"The product on the web has 6 speeds unfortunately when it arrived it had only 3.  It is described as professional but the cord is not sturdy nor is it long.  I was trying to replace the hair dryer that I had and while the name and website description was the same as my old one, the one that arrived was not."
528394,2,"Looks great

The scent when I got it was very strong, and wore off after maybe about an hour of burning now the scent is only there when I am right next to it. Pretty disappointing for the price I paid for it,. Wont buy again"
558556,5,"It is the best hydrating moisturizer I have ever used.  It gives the face glow and hydrates and moisturizes.  It lasts all day long.  I will not go without it anymore.  I was confused how to use it at first then I realized that I should not rub it on my face.  Just spray it on the face once done with applying all facial products or foundation and do not rub it.  It will give a cooling sensation and dries on its own.  After couple usage I noticed the glow on my face and I have no need to re-apply moisturizer or foundation all day long.
Love it!"
77972,5,"Love this product as does my skin!"
59855,5,"Very nice dryer. Dries quickly and leaves hair very soft."
478351,4,"I like this product, but you need to use a TINY amount. A little bit definitely goes a LONG way. Too much and you start looking like a mess! I rub it into the roots of my hair and then when you shake your fingers along your scalp the volume you get is insane! You don't need to rat it out. And I don't suggest you do, or you'll literally look like you have a rats nest on your head. This stuff doesn't mess around!"
65082,5,"On its lowest setting this razor is more aggressive than most are on the highest setting. The head is bulky and take some practice to get into the tight places, like under your nose."
335086,5,"Easy to use.  Good smell.  Works better than the stuff in the can.  Overall a good buy.  I recommend it."

487403,5,"I love the smell nice product beard doesnt look greasy"
149273,5,"The BEST acne treatment ever! Even for ""underground"" pimples that hurt ... they never surface! I apply underneath my make up and cover with concealer|foundation for all day treatmemt! REMINDER: DO NOT SHAKE BOTTLE! Simply dip a Q-tip thru the pink and clear liquid and spot treat. Good for adults too! Highly recommended!"
221309,2,"the blow dryer is awesome blows hard and is lightweight but the nozzel  intensifier does not stay on at all"
82985,2,"This stuff seems great conceptually, but it is very hard to apply to black hair.
It leaves residue and may not be best suited for coarse hair.

Pros: don't really need a whole lot to see the affects.
Smells pretty good.
Cons: not good for black hair (can see residue)
Pricey
Little tough to wash out."
523053,5,"I am a guy and I use a lot of styling products like wax, clay... This product is really good to get rid of the products I use during the day. It leaves my hair really fresh. Love it!"
503471,2,"The smell is very strong. Completely awful and makes me feel nauseous which no other hair spray has done before. It smells like chemicals and is very over powering. It works okay at first spray but doesnt tame any frizz."
521475,4,"This curling iron is great !  Seems to give a softer curl to my hair and I would say it is definitely worth the investment. Does not squeeze the hair as tightly to the barrel which, after getting used to, actually is safer for my thin hair.
You can set the heat which I like. Also appreciate the red light to show it is turned on. Helps me not forget to unplug the unit.

I am taking off 1 star for:
1. Heavy - this is the heaviest curling iron I have ever owned.
2. Very little room at the tip to hold your iron without burning your hand.

Believe me, those are small critiques. I love this curling iron."
65307,5,"I first bought this deodorant after reading in GQ a couple years ago about natural antiperspirants. I tried the Malin + Goetz version of this, which smelled great, but offered little in the way of protection. So I tried this on a whim, and my expectations were met or exceeded in every aspect.

I tend to sweat a decent amount. Probably more than average, but there are definitely people who sweat more than me. This deodorant definitely can last a full day at the office. If I have been sweating more than usual, I may notice a slight odor if I stick my nose right up to my armpit, but barring that, it does a good job blocking odor, comparable to or better than my previous favorite antiperspirant, dove men + care.

My armpits definitely stay dryer with this deodorant than any other that I have used.

The bottle lasts a while - probably 2-3 months or so.

I don't notice any staining on my shirts from using this deodorant, unlike the other synthetic antiperspirants I have used in the past. This is important, as I don't wear undershirts, even to work.

I would recommend this deodorant to anyone who is looking for an effective, reasonably priced natural alternative to the other antiperspirant solutions out there."
121488,5,"This olive-oil based conditioner leaves my hair with a copper/auburn shine. Even though it is olive oil based it rinses out easily and smells great. Unlike so many other products that color-enhance, this one actually deserves the name conditioner. The jar is glass so care is indicated in handling, but it does keeps the product fresh and doesn't interact with the color. I take out the amount I'm going to use and put it into a small plastic container before I get in the shower. I had missed the Aveda Annatto conditioner for the color enhancing qualities but hadn't found it very conditioning on my hair. This product does both and even if Aveda began offering Annatto conditioner again I would not go back."
397752,3,"These are tiny sample of each product. Most of what you're paying for is packaging but that happens with a gift set. The products are good. Not great. If they were a lower price, I would accept a lower standard. But they are okay. Hence the three star rating."
126427,5,"I have been searching for a good hairspray and tried many products then I found this one at Marshall's and love it.  It holds hair yet does not dry out hair or build up in hair making it look frayed at the ends.  Best product ever."
62285,4,"Bought this for my husband twice now. One of these lasts a full year, if not a little longer. He has thick beard hair, and loves this stuff and his safety razor. The aroma isn't overpowering, I love it. Husband loves it too. Solid product. Our only complaint is that the jar lid has cracked on the inside; there's a piece that chips off when he screws the lid back on. It doesn't take away from the cream, and it doesn't make the jar non airtight. Just annoying."
412864,4,"Keeps my beard soft all day."
475547,4,"Its definitely make a clearer facial wash than that without one. I did expect more like to make the pore smaller or brighten the skin. But it surely performs limited functions. Btw, I have no problem of using it as some of the other reviewers said like it stopped working or having charging issues."
367130,5,"Love this product!  My hair feels healthier and happier.  Use Pureology shampoo and conditioner as well."
56407,5,"Arrived on time and this is my favorite perfume!!!"
167197,5,"This stuff is awesome. Goes on easy (or have your partner put it where you need it) and hides my stupid bald spot.

Thanks for getting it to me quickly!"
432272,5,"I have tried different beard oil in the past and this one is by far the one I get the best result with.

I love the scent and how soft my beard gets with it. Furthermore, it is the most oily beard oil I have tested so far, you don't need to apply a lot to get good results."
492547,5,"This is the only body wash that makes me feel extra clean. I noticed my skin looks and feels younger too."
569715,5,"Doesn't take much, one spray is enough.  Great scent, VERY long lasting - much longer than the Varatos cologne I was using before.  Get compliments all the time on it.  Will definitely continue buying."
104531,5,"By far one of the best beauty/skincare products I have ever purchased! This mask is so incredibly soothing to the skin. I've been trying other products (such as Proactive+- which was horrible) and whenever my skin reacts, I can count on this to properly soothe it. Additionally, I think the overall health of my skin has improved some because of the mask. VERY relaxing."
386614,1,"I purchased my first Grandelash through a local reputable Cosmetic business.  It worked wonders on my brows and lashes.  Then I purchased my second here on Amazon.  It was, with out a doubt, a knock off.  The only thing it did for me was cause little blisters on my eyelids and below my eyebrows.  No hair growth whatsoever! To confirm my intuition, I purchased my third round through the same spa as my first purchase.  Sure enough my lashes and eyebrows are growing like crazy again.  People, do not buy Grandelash from this buyer or on Amazon in general...not worth it!!!"
165597,3,"Love this product"
522362,5,"Perfect color for the holidays!"
42232,5,"Strivectin-SD Eye Cream has erased the lines around my eyes and returned my face to its youthful appearance.  I never experienced any redness or irritation, as I had with other products.  This cream is smooth as it moisturizes the eye area and delivers on it's promise.  I am an impressed customer!"
233709,4,"I'm afraid this sunscreen does make my eyes stream and sting (though almost no sunscreens don't.) but I do like the fact that it is not obvious when on, so I use this on my face and neck far away from my eyes. Convenient size and shape bottle."
277315,5,"This product turned out way better than expected. It is by far the softest thing I have put on my face. It really does smooth everything out and my makeup does last longer. I will keep buying this for sure"
79711,5,"If there is 10 stars, i would give it all because it really works for me. The result came out like professional salon result, If anyone wants to save money at salon, buy this product. Strongly recommended."
310692,5,"perfect"
318660,2,"I wanted to love this as much as the Coola matte tinted spf 30 unscented.  I purchased this to use on the days I didn't want any color in my sunscreen.  Unfortunately, the matte cucumber is disappointing.  It doesn't absorb well into the skin, so skin is noticeably whitened.  Also, contents of the tube started clumping after using for about 2 weeks.  When I applied to my skin, I had clumps of the sunscreen that wouldn't absorb sticking to my face.  The texture is not the same as the tinted, unscented version...it's thinner and does not feel as nice on the skin.  The scent is not that noticeable.  This is not a negative for me, but if you are buying based on the scent, it's not that strong.  Love the brand, but cannot recommend this product."
331228,5,"Have purchased the product before and really like it. It's a great luxurious shampoo for color treated hair, lots of moisture and shine."
253836,5,"I will NEVER waste my money on any other eyeliner. This Stilla is the absolute best, hands down.  I have a problem with eyeliner smearing and this will not smear and last all day."
292293,1,"Defective product. Upon arrival, the product will not spray and Amazon will not accept for return."
180418,5,"Heats up pretty fast & I never have to set it on the higest heat level. I leave it on the setting between 380 & 430. Love it for a nice wavy look! For tighter  curls get the 1 inch."
297232,5,"Best hair product I've ever used. Not too sticky or shiny, but with great hold. Great smell and texture as well. The glass jars are also awesome. Works better than previous products I've tried, including MITCH Clean Cut and Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shaping Cream."
396236,5,"Great in ""betweener."""
204492,5,"Love the fresh clean smell!! I get compliments all the time."
296029,5,"This scent is great -- a mix of musky woodsy and crisp clean, and the scent lasts for a good period of time.  Cologne is a personal choice, so I cannot overly vouch for the appeal it will have for someone else.  But, many people have commented to me that they like this one when worn.

I had considered buying this cologne since it debuted, but I waited and finally came back around to get it. The price is fantastic compared to a retail store, so I figured I would give it a try."
445881,1,"This is TINY! It's half the hight of my cell phone! The images are deceiving! Literally half the size of an iphone 7+. If you ration it, you may get 3 uses. Not worth the money spent for such a small amount of produce."
506062,5,"Love this product. Ive been using it for 10+ years. My skin is very sensitive (roseacia) and I have to be careful, this is very gentle, does not dry greasy or cause breakouts,"
127126,5,"this is a great solution for the neck area.  I started using it years ago and it works very well. It was initially recommended to me by a plastic surgeon."
572493,5,"These are without a doubt, the BEST water bottles. I'm going by taste here. I have tried so many different types of water bottles. These have no taste. All you taste is the water you put in it. No funky plastic after taste. No tastes of juice or anything that was in there prior. I will say this, if you're looking for a light weight bottle, these are pretty hefty. The glass is nice and thick. The cover helps you grip it nicely. I just love these. I have in all sizes. I use the liter size for storing water and the smaller ones for drinking."
164845,5,"This is good not only for covering grey but also for making the hair look fuller"
26045,5,"The texture and mild natural scent to this stuff is great. It's a little greasy compared to the usual tube of Cetaphil I carry with me, so this is a bedtime-only moisturizer for me, but it's still really nice."
544446,4,"This mirror was perfect for what I needed, just needed a small compact mirror to toss into my purse.  My only complaint is that it is quite small.  I was hoping that the magnified mirror was the bigger mirror rather than the small, but its working out and serving its purpose!"
143949,5,"Great curling iron.  Keep the extra spring they send you because over time the existing spring does loosen and need to be replaced."
459567,4,"I have to say that this works but only marginally. The nice thing about it is I can remove the label entirely and that's a plus in my book."
23721,5,"I think this is a great product and fills the areas where I am losing hair as I age.  This product does not itch my scalp as some of the other hair builders do.  I recommend such an easy solution for filling in the bare areas of your head."

307244,5,"I'm really pink by nature, not freckly but fair enough that I've got to use a product with at least 30 SPF. This is the first time I've used something other than a zinc oxide sunscreen and I like it.

This clear sunscreen has low viscosity so it spreads very easily and quickly. It also dries quickly and I have the impression of not having it on. There are other clear sunscreens and I've heard people say they feel weightless as compared to the sunscreens we're more accustomed to using.

An example of another clear sunscreen is the Neutrogena Clear Face. It uses the same active ingredients as this Vichy Ideal Capital Soleil brand, so the difference is in the inactive ingredients. As this is the only clear sunscreen I've tried, I cannot compare based on experience but I do like that this one has only a slight fragrance."

250323,5,"This was recommend to me by someone else, and its worth the price. It doesn't leave your hands completely dry as they claim, but certainly as close as I've ever experienced. Mainly, it works wonders and surprisingly fast - hands are nice and soft...when I use it;)"

493899,4,"I like this cream very much and have been using it for several years.  One tube lasts a long time.  The only reason it is a 4 not a five is the tube it comes in -  I'm always fighting to the get last cream out of the tube."

113016,5,"One of my favorite products recommended to me by my dermatologist. Helps with fine lines and very good to hep keep adult acne under control. very nice product."
155275,5,"I have relatively greasy hair. I shower in the mornings, and by mid-afternoon, the oil is obvious. With this dry shampoo, my hair lasts much, much longer. I apply it about 8 hours into the day, and it's enough to keep my hair looking and feeling good until bedtime (I go to school/work 14 hours a day).

I originally bought this for Coachella. I have OCD, and if I don't shower everyday, I can't stand it. This is especially true on hot days. At Coachella, there are limited showers and extremely hot days. I used this product the first day with some no-rinse body wash. It was okay. I had to put my hair up, but it was definitely better than not using anything at all.

This product works a LOT better than Batiste and Algermarin. It's a tiny bottle, but you don't have to use very much, whereas most other dry shampoos are sprays, and you have to use a lot. I've had this little bottle since April 2011, and there's still half in it. I don't use it everyday, of course...only for emergencies.

The application is sort of awkward, but, like I said, it's better than sprays. My boyfriend says that he can sometimes see when I use it, because of residue. It's not as bad as the other dry shampoos that I've tried, though. And the smell is MUCH less intrusive."

140637,5,"This stuff smell amazing!"
406619,5,"I'm a tad OCD when it comes to my hair; so while enduring my first Chicago winter, I found that my hair was the most brittle and dry its been in my entire life.  So I conducted a thorough search on shampoos, conditioners, treatments for dry hair (focusing on products for relaxed African-American hair).  I came across the Awapuhi line and used it for the first time today.  OMG! I could tell during the first wash that there is a considerable difference between shampoos containing harsh sulfates and those containing alternatives. My hair didn't fell stripped after the wash--just (for lack of a better word) nourished... like it'd be thirsty for so long.  I followed it up with the keratin rinse conditioner and styling oil.  This line feels and smells great; I'm in love!"
488704,5,"A little bit after every shampoo and it works great!"
148158,5,"I love this curling iron.  It gets super hot super quickly.  The only criticism I would have is the ""power light"" is on the opposite side of the on and off switch and has caused me to leave it on for days at a time.  My other curling iron had a auto shut off option AND the light was next to the switch."
473241,5,"Very happy, I see the results"
505377,5,"Very nice!"

297199,5,"I love the elegance of Baxter of California products, this product is perfect for my thin hair and the awesome part is, is that the next day if you don't wash your hair you can restyle your hair. The price is a little high for a pomade thats only 2oz but its worth every penny !"
46999,3,"Nothing special about this hair dryer"
439593,1,"I question if this is an authentic product. Doesn't smell the same plus it bubbles a lot more than the bottle I have from a salon."
135643,5,"I has gotten pretty expensive but it seems to last longer than other similar products and it is a great product."
77288,5,"The best, the smell isn't as bad as Ive read. It smells medicated and it really has helped my scalp heal. I have used it 2 times so far which says a lot. African American, damaged chemical treated hair with psoriasis."
545704,2,"Not what I expected. More hair spray like than a textexturizer. Also it look almost three weeks to get to my door. Disappointing."
106949,5,"One of my favorite products! I have been using it on my daughter since she was born!"
551671,3,"This gel like facial product is supposed to lighten dark spots and I used it nightly as a moisturizer and it did help with brightening and cell renewal but it wasn't worth the $48 price tag for the minor impact on my skin as it didn't make the spots go away completely and my skin was pretty much the same as before. There are other brands I like better like Estee Lauder that are at a similar price point."
132745,5,"My husband loves this stuff! Great for filling in thinning hair."
540359,5,"Ive been having terrible atopic skin and my skin was peeling off my face. Steroid cream, lotion and nothing from dermatologist worked.... I just happened to find this cream on Amazon and in the first application my dried skin was gone! Its like a magic!!! Recommend this 100%!"
407345,5,"I love this product.

Some background: I have very dark hair and very light skin, to the point that you can often see the hair under my skin. Shaving has always been a problem for me, leaving horrible razor burn that was so severe it bled for hours. I had basically given up on wearing shorts or short skirts. This product makes it possible for me to dress like a normal person. If you're already at the ""normal person"" stage and you're looking for a way to be even better, this will likely be a disappointment. However, if you're like me, and have always have difficulty with razor burn and sensitive skin, you know just how valuable being ""normal"" can be.

What it WILL NOT do:
-Remove any and all hair as soon as you use it
-Remove faint (light-colored) or light (not dense) hair
-Eliminate 100% of hair

What it WILL do:
-Drastically reduce both the amount of hair AND the coarseness of hair, making it possible to shave like a normal person or even skip shaving for a day or two.
-Greatly eases and expedites the shaving process
-Reduce the appearance of hair UNDER the skin by shrinking the follicle itself, thereby minimizing ""shadow""

Bottom line:
-If your hair is a serious problem, this is your solution. It will bring you up to the ""normal"" level.
-If your hair is merely a nuisance, move along. This it not the product you're looking for.

I am very, very glad to have this. It's made my daily routine so much better, and my legs look better than ever. It doesn't hurt at all, even on the high settings, and it's very easy to use. It is a bit pricey, but considering how many pulses you get, it's well worth the money. I've only done four treatments and am already very impressed with the results - I don't yet know if they'll be permanent, but it has made a significant difference so far. An excellent investment, and one that I've already recommended to friends!"
310307,5,"Nice powder that goes on well and blends well."
295888,5,"He loves it!"
511816,4,"love this serum but too pricey.. replaced this with oribe supershine cream and its better"
197537,5,"Just like the original good stuff"
312645,4,"These products work, feel and smell just like the ones my professional aesthetician uses.  The only problem is that the quantities are so small."
411114,5,"I keep my skin care regimen simple and don't fall prey to the marketing messages that one needs multiple products to keep the skin moisturized and healthy; however I'm really enjoying this delightfully light and fresh primer. It's not quite moisturizing enough for me to forego my moisturizer which I apply immediately after showering; however, a bit later in the morning, when I'm ready to put on the makeup, a tiny dab of the Jouer Moisture Primer spreads smoothly across the skin, leaving no sticky or perfumed residue. The makeup glides smoothly on over the primer, and my face looks fresh and ready for the day (well, as fresh as you can look at my age...) Although the tube is just 1 fl. oz., it appears that it will last for months since such a small amount is required daily."
283454,5,"I'm very pleased with the CND shellac. It wears well, usually 8-12 days. Happy bright green color- this photo is an accurate depiction. I'm sold."
170639,5,"This a good deep cleaning and non-drying cleanser. Add something else if you need deeper exfoliation, but this is great to alternate with another product for cleansing and not drying."
288718,5,"I love this lotion.  The scent is very clean and the lotion is not greasy.  Great service at a great price!"
350896,5,"This is absolutley the best mascara I've ever used! For yrs I have been searching for a mascara that did not smear. I was never able to wear mascara on my lower lashes because within a few hours I looked like a raccoon. This last all day. Lengthens, makes my lashes look long and does not smear. I love it and hope they never stop making it!!! If I could give it ten stars I would."
335458,5,"Good for my dry hair.  Thank you."
342686,4,"Great sunscreen! I have dry, acne-prone skin, and this works well enough for me. I wouldn't recommend using it without a moisturizer if you have dry skin like me, as I found that it tends to emphasize dry patches, and it does have a somewhat greasy texture like most sunscreens. However, I found that it sinks in fairly quickly, and it has never caused me to break out. I only wish it came in a bigger tube - I ran out of this pretty quickly with daily use."
465614,5,"I love this blow dryer!  Really dries my hair faster and styles it better, making it look smooth and soft."
464008,5,"i LOVE these liquid lipsticks!!!  i got a sample in my ipsy bag once and ever since than i had to get my hands on other colors...
this is the perect color for an everyday look or a night out i LOVE IT!!
its minty it gives you a cool tingly feeling on your lips to the point where it feels fresh on your lips but not dry!
i was never the one to wear lipstick or even lip gloss but this literally feels like you have nothing on your lips which makes it very comfortable."
144885,2,"Worked until now. Turns on but no longer heats. Disappointed."
374887,4,"I purchased this on Sephora as their return policy is the best on the market. It's been about 3 weeks and I'm noticing hair falling out in areas that have been treated and markedly slower regrowth. I will return in about 3 or so more weeks to update my review as to the efficacy of this laser when I'm done with the recommended 6 weeks of treatments. As of right now there are no cons that are worthy of a review. The pain level is nothing that can't be controlled with some topical lidocaine. For me the key to using the topical is to dry shave so the skin is slightly broken and it better absorbs the numbing cream. Makes using the Tria on a higher setting a breeze!

Update July 30th - Well it's been a little more than three weeks since my last update. So far I have seen a dramatic decrease in hair growth. Is the hair gone, NO. My final opinion, is if you need the hair gone with 100% guarantee and can afford office treatments then I say go for it. Ultimately the office treatments depending on the area are only slightly more expensive than the tria. If you buy this little gadget you have to understand it's going to take longer than the 6 weeks advertised and even then you may not see the desired results. You have to have a lot of patience with this product and know that this is for hair reduction and may not necessarily be permanent. One thing to mention is that I personally have not had any issues with my battery life, but then again maybe thats cause I leave it plugged in? Not sure. Hope this helps you in your decision!

Pros:
at home convenience
different settings

Cons:
Price is not much cheaper than an office package
May not be permanent
May take longer than 6 to 8 weeks"
132829,5,"Love Toppiks.  I am losing a lot of hair at the top of my head and I have been using Toppiks for many years.  It is easy to apply with little to no mess and stays on all day.  Even if I sweat."
389050,5,"This is the best flat iron I have used.  I found the ""trick"" to using is a good blow dry.  Then I use the flat iron to finish the hair style and with this flat iron my hair looks great for almost a week and has not gotten dried out like it has with other flat irons.  It works very well!"
447971,4,"This cream as a high surface area coverage ratio. So you need to use a fairly small amount to get a natural looking finish. My wife doesn't have oily skin and found the cream easy to apply and effective."
478228,3,"I have long straight hair and wear it sort of like a long Pompadour.  This product does NOT hold hair at all.  Its primary effect is controlling flyways.  Oh, and is smells pretty good.  Other than that, do not expect much."
226135,5,"Best hairspray on the market. And not to mention the best smelling"
258776,5,"Excellent product - works great, makes my hair very soft, lessens Frizz and has a very nice odor. Can be used on dry hair or after shampoo - best results with use of blower."
37097,5,"OK"
477932,5,"This is a great priming base. It easily covers my ridged nails with no streaking; plus it dries fast. Nail color lasts a long time with minimal chipping (not only butter London colors-- I use it with everything). The base is a lovely neutral and often times I wear just it and a top coat. This is a must have and worth the price."
478814,5,"This is the best product ever I highly recommend it .I receive it on Tuesday and Friday my babies face is all cleared up. Best product for baby acne I love it"
316403,5,"Super creamy shadows, very pigmented and blendable! I wish I would have bought it sooner. Definitely a palette I reach for everyday."
445083,5,"I love this i'ts very good for fine lines."
120207,2,"Eh. I wouldn't consider it a scrub. Has bulky bits of almonds but not evenly distributed. Yet gentle enough to use every day. Hard for me to wash off. Leaves a white film on your face then I have to use cleanser to wash off. I would wear as a mask and use cloth for removal. Does leave skin soft and the smell is awesome though."
278129,5,"his one really smells wonderful of pine!"
137282,5,"This product keeps moisture locked in all night. My skin is still moist when I wake up after wearing it overnight."
204674,5,"It's perfect"
434145,4,"Loved the nice selection of products. The Julep nail polish was the highlight. I was ok that some samples were not a deluxe size. Great price point, too."
73803,1,"This is a lovely little cream that you rub on your face and smear your makeup around and then I guess you wash your face with a better cleanser. It literally takes nothing off your face. The directions are super sketchy at best: ""massage in... pat dry... rinsing optional""... huh? I was so confused, I kept checking the front and back of the bottle. ""Did I mistakenly buy moisturizer?"" I think, ""Most of it is in French, perhaps they translated Moisturizer into Dermo-Cleanser?"" If your idea of a gentle cleanser is a $20 cleanser that merely suggests to your makeup that it move around a little, but in fact it stays right where it is, then this product is for you and by the way, I have a bridge I'd like to sell you."
344465,3,"Doesnt stay on too long."
543183,5,"I love this product, makes your hair feel great!"
131791,4,"So I've been using Toppik for about 5 years or so. It's an amazing product. However, today i was so upset when I opened up the top lid of the bottle I've been using for about a year now-( a little honestly goes a long way as you can probably tell).  Ok, back to why I was disappointed - when I opened up the bottle, a found a long piece of someone's grayish white hair!!!!  In a 0.97 oz bottle, that long strand of hair makes a big difference!  I feel cheated, especially since these bottles are not cheap!"
257403,5,"this is by far the best shampoo i've ever used. smells great, rinses clean and the conditioner is awesome!! love!"
364872,5,"Love this product"
122062,2,"I hardly ever use this. What's the point of a dry shampoo if a bunch of powder is visible after you use it? I'm better off just washing my hair the old-fashioned way."
242750,1,"Very watery thin. After two days the ends of my nails were all chipped. Worst nail polish I have ever used"
163123,5,"If you are looking for a night cream for skin that needs more moisturizer then this line is amazing.  I use all the Borghese moisturizing products and they are fabulous.  They are not greasy but keep the skin moist and supple.  I have only used this line for the last 10 years after trying many expensive other brands,  I never break out and get a lot of complements on my skin."
369731,5,"Perfect!"
508742,1,"good but overrated and overpriced . actually most any shampoo does the trick because you don't really wash your hair; you wash your scalp, so the heading, ""shampoo for fine and normal hair"", is, i think, misleading . it does not have to be expensive to wash your scalp."
394401,5,"Love this."
441883,5,"Love OPI!! Great lotion!"
536171,5,"I use it every other day!"
141579,5,"I can't stop spraying this stufffff!!! It's my new addiction! Smells so good and makes me not want to wear foundation and I can feel ""naked"" without it. Hopefully it will improve my skin so much I'm 100% comfortable with my ance scars and psoriasis."
262150,3,"Product Damaged~!, but I will see this product is good or not after replacing"
267695,5,"I had ordered the Shellac Negligee but did not receive the order. I noticed that it had been shipped, but somehow got lost in the mail. When I contacted the shipper, I was assured that I would receive a replacement immediately, and I did. There was no hassle, nothing, just a new shipment. I am so happy to have done business with this company. Thank you. Now on the note about the shellac. It is easy to use and stays put for three to four weeks. It's easy to apply and actually easy to take off with some acetone."
550764,5,"Great lotion. Smells great"
448420,5,"I love this perfume."
483894,3,"Love the color but it flakes off easily"
446287,5,"Excellent, you don't get much of it in the bottle (I've gotten 3-4 applications out of it so far and have maybe 1-2 left if I stretch it; I've used it once a week or less) but my hair is much smoother, appears less damaged from past dying."
336619,5,"I love this stuff. Sure I can get some Trader Joe's shaving cream for a fraction of the price, but this stuff makes you feel like you're in an old-man barbershop getting a shave and a haircut from an old guy named Salvatore...or so I imagine seeing as how I have no need of doing that myself. All I know is I love the classic design on the package and tube, and I love the dry, woody scent of the sandalwood. It works great as well - a little goes a long way. Treat yo self! It's worth it."
467713,5,"Love this stuffGives body to straight blah hair"
104659,2,"The high setting stopped working after 3 months, making the dryer unusable. Good while it lasted."
107127,5,"Absolutely love this lotion---  It's the epitome of delicious baby smell! I use this myself and on the kiddos."
207390,5,"A bit pricey but excellent shampoo."
49826,4,"This stuff lasts forever. Just wished it did not dry out on the skin so much. I mix it with some eye cream."
166448,5,"This product is great. I heard about it from a hairdresser and so far, I really like it. I'm not exactly sure how it works but the powder fills in the thin spots and even covers some grays. It looks very natural! I didn't buy the finishing spray but maybe I will. I have to be careful sometimes because if I have the product in my hair and then I put my sunglasses on top of my head, I'll get dark smudges on face."
286169,5,"It is really good! Nice smell and make my hand and face very soft. I love it!"
375802,5,"Great color!"
2032,1,"My arms have light keratosis pilaris and this really didn't do anything for me. The smell was unpleasant so it was also unbearable to apply this to my skin."
234900,3,"This was an accidental purchase.  I meant to purchase the glytone exfoliating body wash for Keratosis Pilaris (which actually works quite well).  It wasn't worth the trouble to return it.  This is just a gentle facial cleanser.  It does seem to do the job, but I would never spend this much money on face wash that doesn't do anything particularly special."
47482,2,"I got this for my wife for Christmas 2012.  She really liked it.  It did save her time drying her hair and she liked the temperature controls.

Her only complaint was that the on/off and temperature control switches were ""slick"" or ""slippery"" and could be difficult to move as they are flush into the handle grip of the dryer.

In April, the power switch started having issues.  Something inside isn't making good contact and she'd have to shake it or move the switch rapidly (very hard to do) back and forth to get it to power on.  I contacted their warranty service (you eventually wind up at Conair customer service in case you're wondering) to request a replacement unit and was told that I'd have to send the unit in and it would take at least 2 weeks and up to 3 weeks for repair.

My issue here is that after about $40 on a hair dryer with a faulty component the only way to get it repaired meant my wife wouldn't have a hair dryer for 2-3 weeks.  That pretty much means I'm buying my wife a new hair dryer because she's not going to go a couple of weeks without one.  It seems to be sort of a stupid warranty policy for something like this.  I escalated past the first 3 levels of polite, but unaccommodating service reps and finally got a supervisor who was not as polite and pretty much told me that having to buy a new hair dryer while waiting for repair of this one wasn't his problem and that he was upset that I'd forced his employees to bring this issue to him.

Needless to say, we won't be buying anything from BaByliss or ConAir again."
486648,5,"Awesome cleanser! Leaves a clean skin feel and not drying at all."
23893,5,"I have a spot that is thinning at the crown of my head and this works unbelievable at covering it up.  It's literally magic how well this stuff covers up thinning spots.  I don't know if it would be the right product if you actually have a big bald spot because it needs some hair to stick to in order for the hair to look fuller.  Overall this product is a life saver/ confidence restorer!"
210410,5,"OK IF YOU HATE SHAVING?!?! Get this , then go to YouTube look up how to use shaving soap. Watch several videos. Then break out your soap/cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try! If you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet.

I hated shaving! My skin always got irritated and burned after! Then I tried this stuff after watching hours of videos, I broke down and gave it a whack. Now mind you I'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and I get worn out in my chair quickly!!!! After using this I look forward to shaving I can't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause I'm going to shave... I will spend the extra 10 min to get outta  bed to go through the procedure to shave ! My skin comes out so smooth and irritation free!!!!!! And the girlfriend really noticed a difference! Spend the money, spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting !!!"

356095,5,"Awesome product"
191590,5,"I have used this product in the past and love it.  I left my previous bottle in my last post by mistake and was happy to purchase it here.  The only complaint I have is that the mask did not come with the sponge, which is absolutely necessary, in my opinion in removing the mask.  My hope is that it comes in a separate package, but I highly doubt it.  Will give Amazon a call to see if they can send one to me. We'll see."
112911,3,"Appears to work as advertised."
478626,5,"This lipstick has become my new favorite go-to!!!

The Lucky color is a hint lighter than my own lip color but it's absolutely perfect in color for me (fair with blue eyes and blonde hair) as I tend to favor the pinker neutrals in lipstick color.

The formula, for me, is excellent.  It's minty and almost lip balm/chapstick in feel and texture.  It goes on buttery smooth and lasts through lots of water drinking and chewing, which surprised me given how buttery it was.

I can't attest to the mood boosting but having a chapstick like lipstick in my life FINALLY does make me a happy camper so... maybe it does!  Ha!

Overall it's a great lipstick!  Wonderful formula, staying power, feeling and color!"
97195,5,"Hair Type: Long, fine (not thin), color-treated. Easy breakage, split-ends, and falling out.

I decided to purchase these supplements because I've grown fond of my long hair, but it hasn't been looking healthy and it has been falling out at an alarming rate.

Two weeks in, my nails were quite long and my mother commented on how gleaming my hair looked (not knowing I'm taking Phyto).

One month in, my hair was bouncier and noticeably healthier. No more breakage and definitely less hair on my brush and clothing.

Two months in, I'm hooked! Everyone keeps complimenting my lustrous long hair. Once my hair gets to a certain length, it halts. But it has grown at least 2 inches of thicker hair. I wish I could say that my eyelashes have been affected, but they haven't. Nails, eyebrows, and upper lip (albeit blonde) have, though!

At the end of the day, this is a potent multi-vitamin. People will be affected in different ways! I made sure to take the pills as directed (first thing in the morning on an empty stomach with a full glass of water). This obviously helps absorption. I've had zero negative side effects.

Highly recommended."
14661,5,"I don't know about this product working for some but not others; I can only speak for myself.  I used it years ago as a face cream and it was amazing.  I received almost daily compliments on my healthy, glowing skin. I stopped using it when I got pregnant (I was 32 so not a kid with naturally perfect, youthful skin) and just began using it again about a year ago, this time on my stretch marks.  I can say this: you have to BE PATIENT.  Within 5-6 weeks I started to see a major difference in the length, depth, color, and texture of my stretch marks.  I used it, without fail, twice a day every day.  When my last tube ran out, I wondered if the results would last or would fade if I didn't continue using it.  Now I know the answer and I'm online purchasing another tube.  I have not used Strivectin for about two months and my skin doesn't look as good as it did before.  I agree that it is a bit pricey (although far less than the price a few years ago) but, as far as I'm concerned, it is worth every penny."

Warranty- no because I purchased it from Amazon and not a retailer.  So the complaint is with it being broken after just one month after normal use??"

424016,2,"First off, I love the Imperial CLASSIC Pomade... But sadly this product is not the same. I have thin straight hair, about 6-7 inches in length. The scent is slightly different with a fruitier aroma (some people may like it but I find it too strong). The consistency of the product is watery and easy to spread throughout my hair unlike other pomades (Suavecito Firme Hold). It gives off a pretty good sheen to it that lasts throughout the day. However, lacks hold (for a gel I prefer Johnny B Mode Gel). I find it difficult to maintain volume in my hair while maintaining shape as well. It will last about an hour or two before it begins to fall apart. It states it can be reactivated with water but I find that water only really weakens the hold. My last gripe with this product would be that it hardens my hair into a shell like helmet and leaves it feeling very dry and brittle after I wash it off. Overall this product is simply not for me, the attempt to make a hybrid between a pomade and a gel left this product to feel like neither as it lacks the feel of a pomade and the hold of a gel."
340586,5,"These sunglasses are exactly what I was looking for. They are cute and sturdy enough to be handled by a baby. They fit my one year old, a little loose but not bad. I wish it came with a band around the head."
202647,5,"Excellent cream, I love it, good price"
357099,5,"Not only did this dryer cut down the drying time, my hair is very Shiny and Straight. Having an awesome hair dryer cuts down on heat damage because you don't  need to use the higher heat settings on your flat iron because most of the straightening is done with the dryer. I have natural hair that is VERY thick so this product gets 2 thumbs up!"
311506,5,"Does everything it says it will - thicker longer lashes with absolutely no clumping. Chic and cruelty free. I'm in love!"
294369,5,"Finally! A brow makeup that looks good, works well, and STAYS PUT!! I bought Dark (my hair is salt and pepper). I use soft, light, feathery strokes to fill in and shape my brows, AND then I precision line my eyes along my upper lash line.  PERFECTION!"

496534,5,"I first learned of this hair line while in store at Saks while Arcie a line rep did a demo with the hair serum. I absolutely loved that and I have been trying desperately to find a solution to my scalp issues and she recommened this shampoo. I have to say I was hesistant at first but upon using it I was pleasantly surprised. I have such a dry itchy scalp and this shampoo makes it all go away without the horrible scent and feel most dandruff shampoos have. My hair feels silky and hydrated after each use and my scalp is at ease. I am very pleased. One thing that surprised me is that there is not much lather so I usually do two applications in the shower to be sure. A must buy!"
138281,2,"I thought this would be bath oil, but it was liquid soap.  As such it is not aromatic or good for skin.  Kneipp used to make a set of bath oils so I am disappointed that this turned out not to be what I had previously bought.  Also, it is a little deceptive to only call this a ""bath set"" - set of what?"
492656,5,"My skin tone is a light caramel, when i put this product on it gives me a nice tan look. Women with darker skin tones will likely have no problem with the color. My skin therapist recommended this product and within a month i noticed a big difference. I have a lot of hyper pigmentation and dark spots due to my history with acne. With consistent use (2x daily) many of these spots have faded and disappeared (my forehead which used to be riddled with dark spots is now completely clear as is the nose area and cheek area), my skin literally glows. I still have pigmentation around my the sides of my face and a little on my chin but I am pretty sure it will all go away with continued use.  I initially bought this product from my skin therapist but haven't been able to see her in a while, so when I ran out I panicked. I haven't used it in a few weeks since I am out of it, and have noticed the difference without it. So glad to have found it on Amazon at a good price as this little 1 oz bottle can get pricey."
312289,5,"So cute I loved it!!!"
300795,3,"Not quite as bright aqua as expected and shown but still a great color!"
200668,5,"I have never used such a wonderful body cream in my life.  It truly moisturizes better than anything else and stays moisturized until the next shower time.
Only drawback is that I used one jar every 2 weeks and it becomes very expensive at $44.00 a jar.  Wish there was a discount for buying large quantities."
536736,5,"I ordered these for my friend who couldn't get them.  She received the shipment from me.  Said that they are perfect and greatly trust the brand.  For some odd reason, these couldn't be shipped to Australia."
137896,5,"best shampoo i've had from Amazon."
43341,5,"my husband uses this he loves it"
514179,1,"I brought this product over a month ago due to alllllll of the reviews and videos that I have watched online and it is the worst purchase I have ever made.  I am upset that I have waited this long to open it because now I cant get my money back.  I should have tried it out right away.  I would not recommend this product to anyone"
257798,1,"After reading the highly-rated reviews I had such high hopes for this product.  I have used it for the past 3 months, but sadly I still have brittle, splitting nails."
249225,5,"Item was exaclty what I wanted, got here faster then I thought it would arrive. Shipped next day, item was sealed in box and had a very reasonable priced. VERY HAPPY"
285893,5,"Slightly pricey...but well worth the looks and compliments. Plus it's not as common and some of the more popular colognes."
466729,5,"Works perfect!!! I bought one for me ... then came back and got one for each of my sisters!!"
313134,2,"Sad joke! Lasted less than 3 months, completely died with normal use. Was wonderful when it worked. For the price, not worth only 88 days of use. Warranty - takes a full month AFTER clarisonic receives it back to get a replacement. A month is a lengthy time to wait. Also took customer service 4 days to return my call & that was only after i contacted them again. Fyi - informed warranty on replacement starts from day of original unit & not the new one. Inconvienced all the way around, i have to travel to return, wait 30 days for replacement, be without a unit that long. Their customer service is lacking."
100944,4,"Pretty good since I wash my hair infrequently because of the style I wear.  Have bought more than once."
236225,5,"My mom introduced me to the Glytone Products(and Retin A) 13-15 years ago. I started using the products ( glytone mild get wash, glytone step up rejuvenate facial cream in the morning and retin a at night) What I noticed after the dead skin flaked off was that my acne was clearing up!! As time went on I decided it was too expensive and started trying other products from the drug store. I started breaking out again! My husband didn't have a problem with paying for Glytone and Retin A but I was trying to save money. I finally decided it was worth the extra money to not look like some of the before pictures you see on the acne commercials (and yes I tried those too) It is worth the extra money!! My skin is clear and smooth and the added bonus of a younger looking skin. ( because of my acne I finally get insurance to pay for the retin a)"
117810,5,"I went from canned shaving gel to cake soap and brush about three years ago, sometimes with mixed results. Then I decided to try this Proraso cream. Man what a difference!! I put a small amount in a bowl, lather it up with a brush, and apply. I not only get a smoother shave, but it doesn't clog up the razor like the cake soap did. After six months of using it I am still a happy user.

I'm hooked! No going back now."
142070,4,"Refreshing!!!"
417802,5,"Keeps my curly hair soft and tangle free!"
249550,5,"Excellent my favorite... quality product works as described"
214780,1,"The product didn't have the lid coming along with. And it looks CHEAP, dirty, without any seal. I guess someone used it before or even it is the fake one. Feel like I were tricked by the seller. Don't know why I bought it from this seller.
*******
NOT RECOMMEND"
244056,5,"I only buy Vinylux nail polish now. It lasts for a week, sometimes longer! This color definitely requires 3 coats compared to most since it is a lighter shade, but it's a great shade because it's not an obnoxious yellow and looks more professional. I usually stick to darker colors, but this is a good color for a change up."
491024,4,"I recommend this vitamines so good for you hairs."
474065,1,"My daughter visited over the holidays and brought with her a bottle of Loma Organic Moisturizing Shampoo. The outside of the bottle was a pale green color. I tried it and just loved what it did for my hair. I ordered a bottle from Amazon on line and when it arrived the bottle was a dark green color. After using the shampoo, it was not the same effect on my hair as the lighter green bottle. Loma  had changed the look of the packaging and also the ingredients of the shampoo. Was very disappointed with the results from the different packaging. Please bring back the way it used to be in the lighter bottle. Had to send this purchase back."
424065,5,"Really good stuff after a long time searching. I bought this and Suavecito both at the same time to try them out. This is an all day hold and keeps a shine. Leo DiCaprio in Gatsby look."
355481,5,"The color is true to the picture! I think it's a perfect color for fall, and I received the product a day before my expected delivery date! I am very pleased."
360314,5,"Just bought this product. It takes some practice but this was the FIRST time I have ever been able to apply false eyelashes, thanks to this tool! I will definitely be  keeping this with me for weekly uses. It feels sturdy and the overall design works well. I'll update on durability if needed, with time."
553504,5,"Color exactly as on a picture"
10249,5,"First off, though this shampoo is for men, I'm female. I wasn't able to get my husband to use this more than once, and he liked the scent but wanted something more conditioning (his hair is long, past his shoulders, and coarse). My hair is shoulder length, thick and color treated, and this shampoo worked great. It reminded me a lot of those ""clean"" kinds of shampoo you can get which are supposed to hinder buildup -- this Baxter of California Protein Shampoo never built up at all. It rinsed clean but there was still mint scent, and it's been difficult for me to find a good mint shampoo. Even with my longer hair, about 5 pumps was all I needed to shampoo thoroughly, so it lasted quite a while. I will definitely be buying this again."
481074,5,"These were all products I wanted to try. The sizes are similar to what you would get in a store promotion. While they may not be worth the price on their own, it is worth the price to try the products and then use the cost toward a full size product of your choice."
343536,5,"This soap is awesome. Smells great and well worth it."
131782,5,"This saved me"
564536,5,"Those Products  are excellent, nice, was for a present, ant he person love it..."
477171,5,"Very grateful of the product thank you."
245483,5,"Love this stuff.  Been using it for many years.  Good hold with out the weight and smells great."
265953,5,"Wonderful color, true to photo!"
568494,5,"These reviews are so weird. PERSONALLY, I have used hundreds of conditioners, because I am a little bit obsessed lol, this is one of the BEST conditioners for thick course, DRY hair. My 2 daughters love it too. Our hair is SILKY soft and smells yummy. and its so pretty in the sun it glimmers.
Make sure you use a good clarifying shampoo with this first time, so you get the junk out of your hair first. All conditioners will make your hair weird if you don't use a clarifying shampoo every other week. I highly recommend this conditioner, use just a tiny bit and every other day, it goes fast in my house!"
155547,5,"I discovered Jane Iredale at my dermatologist's office. Pressed base gives the most natural coverage! I use the JI blush as well. I often get compliments on how healthy my skin appears. It's a little more expensive than many products but well worth it. In ordering it through Amazon as opposed to JI website I have never had a problem with the quality. This is top of the line make up!"
144842,4,"Easy to use
  Love it."
57148,5,"So nice, smell good, feel fresh all Day,  five star,

Thank You"
511730,5,"I use in conjunction with Jack Black daily moisturizer.  Great product.  At 49 years of age, I get regular comments about my skin quality and the lack of age in my eye areas.  I'll keep using and this transaction was seamless.  Recommended and will use again."
546176,5,"Wonderful stuff! I work in a hospital trauma/surgical intensive care unit. Odors can be notoriously strong. This is the only cologne I have ever worn where nurses often say, ""YOU SMELL GOOD!"". This is my second bottle!"
199698,5,"ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT WHEN I HAVE A MISERABLE DAY THIS STUFF HELPS ME FORGET ABOUT IT. GUYS DON'T PAMPER THEMSELVES ENOUGH AND THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO START. I ALSO USE THE CADE SHAVE BALM AS WELL AS THE SPLASH AND THE FEW EXTRA BUCKS ARE WORTH IT."
30018,5,"I'm addicted to the taste of this toothpaste!!! Love it!!"
64287,3,"I'm a hairdresser and I had this blowdryer for a lil over a year and I loved it. It was always real hot, quiet, light weight.  Then it dies on me but I loved it so much I decided to get another one this time off amazon instead of thehair store.  I guess they redesigned it or something because after 2 wks of having it got really loud the cool shock would come on every 5 seconds like w the old red chi blowdryer(the reason I stopped using that one as well). And it doesn't get as hot as the old rocket I had. I don't know whether it's chi fault and I got their crappy mistake or if it was amzons fault but either way a month after I bought it I had to go by a new blowdryer that worked faster."
490332,3,"I'm a huge fan of Proraso's green, menthol after shave lotion so I thought I'd try this one since I also like sandalwood.  This is okay.  There is a less expensive version available at any discount store called 'Old Spice'."
369737,5,"One of the bottles was not close properly & some of the liquid was spill"
342463,4,"My hair finally grew long enough so that all of the color could be cut out and I was left with with yellowish hair which I attributed to the horrifically high rust content of my water!  I purchased this conditioner to try to counteract that problem, and it did.  I will continue to use it as I am now--a few times per week.  I would hardly call it a conditioner, it leaves my hair very, very dry and I actually need to use another product to handle the conditioning if the hair itself. The smell is somewhat off-putting, but does not linger.  Having said all this, I purchased it to brighten my hair and to keep it from yellowing.  It does this well, and I will continue to use it,  In the interim I have tried other products which smelled better and did not dry out my hair.  However, they did not work.  Therefore...."
325043,5,"I almost couldn't justify spending 20$ on a comb but its a great feeling comb. heavy and thicker than i thought which i thought would be a problem for parting but it actually works great. less static with hair as well because im used to using the cheap black ones because i get them for free from the country club i work at. If you have 20$ i recommend it, if not the cheap black ones are fine too! just has a nice feel to it"
492447,1,"This is the worst face lotion I have ever used. I figured I would take a chance at getting a more expensive face lotion and really regret my purchase. I have been using this for a week and my skin is the driest it has ever been. My face is literally flaky with dead skin, which has never been a problem for me. Thank god i didn't throw out my Burts Bees face lotion and night cream yet, or i would still look like a flaky zombie. Dont waste the $40. Buy Burts bees face lotion/night cream on amazon for a quarter of the price if you want something that works."
275495,5,"I have been using this for the past year, and love it.  My favorite thing about this is how easily it washes out.  I  have thick short hair and style my hair to a classic side part.  This keeps my hair neat, and looking natural, doesn't have much shine."
530684,5,"This one bottle will never last me long enough. This is one of those lovely colors that has multiple personalities depending upon the number of layers, and if you layer it over another color. Scrumptious!"
130331,5,"Love this brush.  Styles my hair perfectly! I would rate it a 5! Please Do Not Stop making it!!!"
460677,5,"I love it!"
28826,5,"What a cute color! one of my favorites, love the texture and fun green, light and kinda sparkly too"
40493,5,"I've been using Paul Mitchel products for decades. I wouldn't use anything else. The foam is fantastic."
357606,5,"This was put on my hair at a salon a while back and it was so good to my hair and smells just like the title says! If you don't like leave-in conditioners, this one will change your mind and your hair will thank you!"
7337,5,"loved it"
277723,5,"Wow -- this eye serum is fantastic.  From the very first application, it works well to tighten the skin around my eyes and give it a silky texture.  Even better, my extremely sensitive skin tolerates it well enough for me to use it every day.

The applicator takes a few tries to get used to, mostly because it needs to be primed.  You also must pull on the trigger and then sweep the wand over your skin.  (At first, I tried to expel the eye treatment by pressing it against my skin.  Ouch.)  The serum glides on effortlessly.  You can feel the tingle within seconds.

I like that Juice Beauty uses organic and natural ingredients to improve the look of the delicate skin around the eye.  It's soothing, brightening, and tightening, all without irritation.

281860,5,"Really nice happy color, my favorite"
548312,3,"It's nice but I was expecting something more special, like kiehls, the smell of it it's ok but nothing of honey in my opinion."
147116,5,"this is the best straghtner I have ever owned I have owned it for about 4 years now and it is still going strong!"
260760,5,"I love this blowdryer. The sound it makes is not as annoying as some of the high-pitched blowdryer motors. It has 3 heat and 2 air settings, which is perfect. Also, the cool shot actually works! The last blowdryer I had the cool shot never really got cool."
133618,5,"I like this product. It just blends in and has great coverage all day! The price is good too! I always buy this product!"
